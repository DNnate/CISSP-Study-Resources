[Domain 1](#domain1-top) **Security and Risk Management**

[1.1](#1.1) Understand, adhere to, and promote professional ethics (OSG-9 Chpts 1,19)

- As a CISSP, you must understand and follow the (ISC)² code of ethics, as well as your organization’s own code. 
- 1.1.1 (ISC)² Code of Professional Ethics: The ISC2 Code of Ethics applies only to information security professionals who are members of ISC2. CISSPs who violate the ISC2 Code of Ethics are subject to certification revocation.
  - (ISC)² Code of Professional Ethics -- take the time to read the [code of ethics](www.isc2.org/Ethics)
  - At a minimum, know and understand the ethics canons: 🟡 PAPA
    - **🔥I: Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure**
      - this is “do the right thing”; put the common good ahead of yourself 
      - ensure that the public can have faith in your infrastructure and security
    - **🔥II: Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally**
      - always follow the laws 
      - but if you find yourself working on a project where conflicting laws from different countries or jurisdictions apply, you should prioritize the local jurisdiction from which you are performing the services
      - Treat all members fairly. In resolving conflicts, consider public safety and duties to principals, individuals and the profession in that order.
    - **🔥III: Provide diligent and competent service to principles** 
      - avoid passing yourself as an expert or as qualified in areas that you aren’t 
      - maintain and expand your skills to provide competent services
    - **🔥IV: Advance and protect the profession**
      - don’t bring negative publicity to the profession 
      - provide competent services, get training and act honorably 
      - think of it like this: If you follow the first three canons in the code
  of ethics, you automatically comply with this one
- 1.1.2 Organizational code of ethics
  - You must also support ethics at your organization; this can be interpreted to mean evangelizing ethics throughout the organization, providing documentation and training around ethics, or looking for ways to enhance the existing organizational ethics 
    - some organizations might have slightly different ethics than others, so be sure to familiarize yourself with your org’s ethics and guidelines
    - All ISC2 certified professionals are required to ⭐comply with the ISC2 Code of Ethics. All employees of an organization are required to ⭐comply with the organization's code of ethics.
    - The federal code of ethics (or, more formally, the Code of Ethics for Government Service) only applies to federal employees and would not apply to a nonprofit organization.
   - **Code of Ethics Complaints**: (ISC)2 members who encounter a potential violation of the Code of Ethics may report the possible violation to (ISC)2 for investigation by filing a formal ethics complaint, identifying the specific canon of the Code of Ethics that the member believes has been violated. Complaints under the Code of Ethics must be in writing and in the form of a sworn affidavit. Furthermore, complaints are only accepted from those who believe they have been injured by the alleged behavior. This personal injury provides standing to file a complaint and is determined based on the canon involved:
  - Any member of the general public may file a complaint involving canons I or II.
  - Only an employer or someone with a contracting relationship with the individual may file a complaint under canon III.
  - Other professionals may file a complaint under canon IV. It is important to note that this is not limited to cybersecurity professionals. Anyone who is certified or 🧠licensed as a professional and 🧠subscribes to a code of ethics as part of that licensure or certification is eligible to file a canon IV complaint.

- **Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics**: The Computer Ethics Institute created its own code of ethics (http://cpsr.org/issues/ethics/cei). The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics are as follows:
     - 1. Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.
       2. Thou shalt not interfere with other people’s computer work.
       3. Thou shalt not snoop around in other people’s computer files.
       4. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal.
       5. Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.
       6. Thou shalt not copy proprietary software for which you have not paid.
       7. Thou shalt not use other people’s computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
       8. Thou shalt not appropriate other people’s intellectual output.
       9. Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.
       10. Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.

[1.2](#1.2) Understand and apply security concepts (OSG-9 Chpt 1)
- 1.2.1 Confidentiality, integrity, and availability, authenticity and nonrepudiation (5 Pillars)
  - 🔴**Confidentiality**:
    - Concept of measures used to ensure the protection of the secrecy of data, objects, and resources
    - is the duty to ensure privacy. It focuses on data
    - It is a legal obligation in regulatory scenarios and a due care obligation in U.S law
    - Confidentiality protections prevent disclosure while protecting authorized access
    - Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including the means for protecting personal privacy and prioprietary information
    - Sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII) must be kept confidential; confidentiality is different from secrecy
    - Preserving confidentiality means protecting an asset or data, even if it's not a secret
    - Violations of confidentiality include stealing passwords, eavesdropping, and social engineering.
  
  - 🔴**Integrity**:
    - Concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data; guarding against improper info modification/destruction; includes ensuring non-repudiation and authenticity
    - Integrity protection prevents unauthorized alterations of data
    - Preventing unauthorized subjects from making modifications
    - Preventing authorized subjects from making unauthorized modifications, such as mistakes
    - Maintaining the internal and external consistency of objects

  - 🔴**Availability**:
    - Authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects
    - To ensure high availability of services and data, use techniques like failover clustering, site resiliency, automatic failover, load balancing, redundancy of hardware and software components, and fault tolerance

  - 🔴**Authenticity**: ensuring a transmission, message or sender is legitimate (Proof of Origin)   
    - See the NIST glossary for examples: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/authenticity

  - 🔴**Nonrepudiation**: 
    - Ensures that the subject of activity or who caused an event cannot deny that the event occurred
    - Nonrepudiation is made possible through identification, authentication, authorization, accountability, and auditing

  - 🔴**AAA Services**: The required elements of accountability, as defined in AAA services, are as follows: identification (which is sometimes considered an element of authentication, a silent first step of AAA services, or represented by IAAA), authentication (i.e., identification verification), authorization (i.e., access control), auditing (i.e., logging and monitoring), and accounting.
    - 🍮Identification: claiming to be an identity when attempting to access a secured area or system
    - 🍮Authentication: proving that you are that claimed identity via one or more factors (something you have, something you know, something you are)
    - 🍮Authorization: defining the needed resources, permissions (i.e. allow/grant and/or deny) to a resource, and object access for a specific identity or subject
    - 🍮Auditing: recording a log of the events and activities related to the system and subjects
    - 🍮Accounting: (aka accountability) access control process which records info about attempts by all entities to access resources; reviewing log files to check for compliance and violations in order to hold subjects accountable for their actions, especially violations of organizational security policy
- 🔵**disclosure, alteration, and destruction (DAD)**: The CIA triad may also be described by its opposite: disclosure, alteration, and destruction (DAD). While the order of the individual components of the CIA acronym sometimes changes, the DAD acronym is shown in that order
     - Disclosure is the unauthorized release of information,
     - Alteration is the unauthorized modification of data, and
     - Destruction is making systems or data unavailable. 
 
[1.3](#1.3) Evaluate and apply security governance principles (OSG-9 Chpt 1)
- Governance is the process in which senior management directs an organization to meet its objectives. Governance must involve oversight to ensure that the goals set by senior management have been met. When performing security governance, security managers need to keep security objectives in alignment with business objectives.
    - Without senior management's approval of and commitment to an information security program, it will remain weak and provide little benefit 
- **Security governance**: 🌠the collection of policies, roles, processes/practices used to make security decisions in an org; related to supporting, evaluating, defining, and directing the security efforts of an org 
  - 🌠Security governance is the implementation of a security solution and a management method that are tightly interconnected. It is NOT an IT-only issue.
  - 🌠The **top-down approach** is the aspect of security governance that is based on the idea that senior management is responsible for the success or failure of a security endeavor. 
  - 🌠Security governance is the collection of practices related to supporting, defining, and directing the security efforts of an organization.
  - 🌠Security governance directly oversees and gets involved in all levels of security.
  - 🌠Security governance requires a clear understanding of the objectives of the organization as the core concepts of security and indeed the primary goals and objectives of security should be the CIA Triad
  - 🌠Security governance seeks to compare the security processes and infrastructure used within the organization with knowledge and insight obtained from external sources.
  - 🌠Security governance should include acquisitions, divestitures, and governance committees. 
  - There are numerous security frameworks and governance guidelines, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 🔥SP 800-53 Cybersecurity Framework and 🔥SP 800-100
- **The security function**: the aspect of operating a business that focuses on the task of evaluating and improving security over time 
  - To manage security, an org must implement proper and sufficient security governance
  - The act of performing a risk assessment to drive the security policy is the clearest and most direct example of management of the security function
- **Third-party governance**: external entity oversight that may be mandated by law, regulation, industry standards, contractual obligation, or licensing requirement; outside investigator or auditors are often involved
- 1.3.1 Alignment of security function to business strategy, goals, mission, and objectives
  - **Security Management Planning**: ensures proper creation/implementation/enforcment of a security policy, and alignment with org strategy, goals, mission, and objectives
       - 🥑**Strategic Plan**: a strategic plan is a 🔥long-term plan (useful for 5 years); it defines the org's security purpose. A strategic plan should include risk assessment. Strategic plans are the longest type of security management plan. They describe overall security goals and can be viable for up to five years.
       - 🥑**Tactical Plan**: mid-term plan (🔥1 year or less) developed to provide more details on accomplishing the goals set forth in the strategic plan or can be crafted ad hoc based on unpredicted events. Tactical plans are the next longest and describe 📝how particular goals can be accomplished. They're usually good for about a year.
       - 🥑**Operational Plan**: a 🔥short-term, highly detailed plan based on strategic or tactical plans. It is valid or useful only for a short time. Operational plans have an extremely short duration. They provide in-depth detail on how the organization will accomplish tasks to support their strategic or tactical plans.
- Strategy ▶️ goals ▶️ missions and objectives — support each other in a heirarchy
    - **Objectives**: are closest to the ground-level and represent small efforts to help you achieve a mission 
    - **Missions**: represent a collection of objectives, and one or more missions lead to goals; when you reach your goals, you are achieving the strategy
  - A security framework must closely tie to mission and objectives, enabling the business to complete its objectives and advance the mission while securing the environment based on risk tolerance
- 1.3.2 Organizational processes (e.g., acquistions, divestitures, governance committees)
  - Security governance should address every aspect of an org, including organizational processes of acquisitions, divestitures, and governance
  - Be aware of the risks in acquisitions (since the state of the IT environment to be integrated is unknown, due diligence is key) and divestitures (how to split the IT infrastructure and what to do with identities and credentials)
  - 🔮Acquisitions and mergers place an organization at an increased level of risk. Such risks include ✏️inappropriate information disclosure, ✏️data loss, ✏️downtime, and ✏️failure to achieve sufficient return on investment (ROI). Acquisition concerns include consolidating security functions and policies as well as integrating security tools.
  - 🔮Divestiture occurs when something is being removed from the organization, whether a device, service, employee, or partnership. Security processes should be implemented at these times to reduce the risk of ✏️data loss and ✏️data leakage, such as sanitizing assets, remove and destroy storage media, and debrief ex-employees. The ✏️protection of intellectual property is a greater concern during a divestiture, where a subsidiary is being spun off into a separate organization, than an acquisition, where one firm has purchased another. 
  - Understand the value of governance committees (vendor governance, project governance, architecture governance, etc.)
  - Executives, managers and appointed individuals meet to review architecture, projects and incidents (security or otherwise),and provide approvals for new strategies or directions 
    - The goal is a fresh set of eyes, often eyes that are not purely focused on information security
  - When evaluating a third-party for your security integration, consider the following:
    - on-site assessment
    - document exchange and review
    - process/policy review
    - third-party audit
- 1.3.3 Organizational Roles and Responsibilities
  - ✴️Senior Manager: has a responsibility for organizational security and to maximize profits and shareholder value. Senior managers play several business continuity planning roles. These include setting priorities, obtaining resources, and arbitrating disputes among team members.
  - ✴️Security Professional: has the functional responsibility for security, including writing the security policy and implementing it
  - ✴️Asset/Data Owner: responsible for ✏️classifying information✏️ for placement or protection within the security solution. Data owner is typically a senior leader who delegates operational responsibility to a data custodian
  - ✴️Custodian: responsible for the task of implementing the proscribed protection defined by the security policy and senior management. The data custodian role is assigned to an individual who is responsible for implementing the security controls defined by policy and senior management. 
  - Auditor: responsible for reviewing and verifying that the security policy is properly implemented
- 1.3.4 Security control frameworks **🔥🔥Focuses on the HOW🔥🔥**
  - **Security Control Framework**: It is a prescriptive set of cybersecurity safeguards and best practices to protect an organizations assets. It helps in implementing risk managment strategy. outlines the org's approach to security, including a list of specific security processes, procedures, and solutions used; it is important in planning the structure of an org's security solution;
  -  ✴️Security Control Assessment (SCA) is the formal evaluation of a security infrastructure's individual mechanisms against a baseline or reliability expectation. The goals of an SCA are to
       - 🍮ensure the effectiveness of the security mechanisms
       - 🍮evaluate the quality and thoroughness of the risk management processes of the organization, and
       - 🍮produce a report of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the deployed security infrastructure.
  - Security is established by understanding the assets of an organization that need protection and understanding the threats that could cause harm to those assets. Then Security controls are selected that provide protection for the 📝CIA Triad of the assets at risk
  - If a security control's benefits cannot be quantified, evaluated, or compared, then it does not actually provide any security.
  - An SCA's goals are to verify security, assess the effectiveness of security, and identify the strengths and weaknesses of security through its risk management processes. A Security Control Assessment (SCA) 📝does not recommend solutions.
  - The six main types of security controls include the following:
      - 🌲Recovery: Recovery controls restore normal operations after an incident to a greater extent than corrective ones. Backups and server clusters are examples of recovery controls.
      - 🌲Preventive: Preventive controls are designed to stop an incident from happening. Fences, locks, and access controls are examples of preventive controls.
      - 🌲Detective: Detective controls help identify that an incident is occurring. CCTV, audit trails, and honeypots are examples of detective controls.
      - 🌲Corrective: Corrective controls fix issues after a security incident. Antimalware that removes an infection or an auto-close arm on a door are examples of corrective controls.
      - 🌲Deterrent: Deterrent controls attempt to discourage an incident from occurring. Corporate policies and security cameras are examples of deterrent controls.
      - 🌲Compensating: Compensating controls are used as a replacement when the preferred control is unusable. For example, a company renting an office in a building may put locks on the doors when it can't build a fence.
  - there are many frameworks to choose from, such as:
    -  🔴**Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT)** ("moderately referenced" on the exam)
        - COBIT is a documented set of best IT security practices by ISACA for information technology (IT) management and governance. COBIT (formerly Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) created by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) is a framework used to establish effective security governance within an organization.
        - Six key principles (🟡Sally Has Daring Goals To Excel SHDGTE) :
          - ✏️provide stakeholder value
          - ✏️holistic approach
          - ✏️dynamic governance system
          - ✏️governance distinct from management
          - ✏️tailored to enterprise needs
          - ✏️end-to-end governance system   
    -  🔴ISO 27000 series (27000, 27001, 27002, etc.).
          - 15408 evaluation Criteria
          - 22301  security and resilience
          - **27001 (🔥🔥Focuses on WHAT and WHY🔥🔥)** information security standards/controls: Outlines a framework for implementing, maintaining and continually improving ISMS Information Security Management System (ISMS is a set of policies, processes and controls that helps organization protect thier information assets). ISO 27001 Guides organizations in identifying assets and assessing thier values and information risks AND implementing mitigating security controls based on ISO 27002. CLoud platforms all have ISO 27001.  ISO 27001 is an international standard on how to manage information security and is not specific to U.S. federal systems. 
          - **27002 (🔥🔥Focuses on HOW🔥🔥)** titled "Information technology—Security techniques—Code of practice for information security management: offers information security guidance: Offers best practices and Control objectives related to key aspects of cybersecurity in support of ISO/IEC 27001. Focuses on cryptography, human resource security, operational security, and incident response. Serves as an official blueprint for orgs aiming to effectively safeguard information assets from cyber threats.
          - 27031 Business continuity    
    - 🔴**The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)** is a standard that helps organizations design, plan, implement, and govern information technology architecture. TOGAF uses the Architecture Development Method (ADM) to create architectures for business, data, applications, and technology.
        - TOGAF helps organizations align their business goals with IT strategies, ensuring that all aspects of the enterprise architecture are considered and integrated effectively.
        - Architecture Development Method (ADM): The central feature of TOGAF, the ADM provides a step-by-step approach to developing an enterprise architecture. It includes phases like:
            - Preliminary Phase: Setting up the architecture capability.
            - Architecture Vision: Defining the scope, stakeholders, and high-level vision.
            - Business Architecture: Developing the business architecture.
            - Information Systems Architecture: Developing data and application architectures.
            - Technology Architecture: Developing the technology architecture.
            - Opportunities and Solutions: Identifying potential solutions and opportunities.
            - Migration Planning: Planning the implementation and migration path.
            - Implementation Governance: Ensuring the architecture's implementation adheres to the design.
            - Architecture Change Management: Managing changes to the architecture.
            - Enterprise Continuum: A classification mechanism to organize reusable architecture and solution artifacts.
            - Architecture Repository: A place to store different architectural outputs like frameworks, standards, and guidelines.
      - TOGAF can integrate with the SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) framework to address security-specific architecture. Security is embedded in every phase of the ADM. CISSP candidates should understand how TOGAF ensures that 📝security is considered throughout the architecture development process. 
    - 🔴**SABSA (Sheerwood Applied Business Security Architecture):**  is a framework and methodology for developing risk-driven enterprise information security architectures. It 🧠integrates security into the business processes and aligns security measures with business goals🧠. provides a structured method for designing, implementing and managing security architectures.
    -  It provides a holistic, business-­driven approach to security architecture, encompassing everything from assessing business requirements to implementation and metrics.
    -  It is recognized for its comprehensive life cycle approach to security architecture, from assessing business requirements to establishing a “chain of traceability” through strategy, concept, design, implementation, and metrics stages
    -  SABSA Lifecycle Phases: 🟡 SDIM
        - ✏️Strategy Phase: Understanding business context and defining security goals.
        - ✏️Design Phase: Developing the detailed architecture.
        - ✏️Implementation Phase: Deploying the security solutions.
        - ✏️Management Phase: Ongoing management and adaptation of the security architecture.  
    -  🔴**FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Managment Programme)** regulates 🧠cloud security for US Gov. FedRAMP specifies a set of security controls based on NIST SP 800-53. It provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.
    -  FedRAMP is a U.S. government compliance program that standardizes how cloud services are assessed, monitored, and handle authorization. There is a FedRAMP marketplace for service providers and services that have been authorized by FedRAMP.

          - ✏️respond
          - ✏️recover
- 1.3.5 Due care/due diligence
  - 🔴**Due diligence**: 🕵️ establishing a plan, policy, and process to protect the interests of the organization; due diligence is about understanding your security governance principles (policies and procedures) and the risks to your organization; actions taken by a vendor to demonstrate or provide due care
    - 💥Due diligence is defined in Black's law dictionary as "Such a measure of prudence, activity, or assiduity, as is properly to be expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent man under the particular circumstances; not measured by any." Taking reasonable actions that a jury of your peers (if there is a jury) would agree are reasonable actions is due diligence.
    - Due diligence often involves: 
      - gathering information through discovery, risk assessments and review of existing documentation 
      - ✏️developing a formalized security structure containing a security policy, standards, baselines guidlines, and procedures 
      - documentation to establish written policies
      - due diligence includes the preparation and research
      - disseminating the information to the organization
      - Due diligence is ✏️knowing what should be done and planning for it.
      - The due diligence principle is a more specific component of due care that states that an individual assigned a responsibility should exercise due care to complete it accurately and in a timely manner.
      - Due diligence is developing a formalized security structure containing a security policy, standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures.
      - The 🥇asset owner security role is ultimately responsible for due diligence in protecting a company's data. Asset owner is the person who has final corporate responsibility for the protection and storage of data. Owners may be liable for negligence if they fail to perform due diligence in establishing and enforcing security policy to protect and sustain sensitive data.
  - 🔴**Due care**: 🧑‍🏭 practicing the individual activities that maintain the due diligence/ security effort; due care is about your legal responsibility within the law or within org policies to implement your org’s controls, follow security policies, do the right thing and make reasonable choices
      - 💥Due care is defined in Black's law dictionary as "Just, proper, and sufficient care, so far as the circumstances demand it; the absence of negligence. This term, as usually understood in cases where the gist of the action is the defendant’s negligence, implies not." Negligence occurs when harm or injury occurs because of the companies' actions or inaction. 
  - Due care is ✏️doing the right action at the right time.
  - It is often called the prudent man rule. Gross negligence is the opposite of due care.
  - exercise reasonable security measures to protect assets
  - it imposes a standard of care upon an individual that is broad and equivalent to what one would expect from a reasonable person under the circumstances
  - Once due dilligence is done, you must use due care while undertaking the actions to protect the interests of the organization, and the customers information
  - Due care is the ✏️continued application of a security structure onto the IT infrastructure of an organization.
  - Due care also includes periodic security audits
  - The due care principle states that an individual should 🧠react in a situation using the same level of care that would be expected from any reasonable person. It is a very broad standard.
  - After establishing a framework for governance, security awareness training should be implemented, including all new hires, who complete the security awareness training as they come on board, and existing employees who should recertify regularly (typically yearly)
  - 🍎**The Prudent Man Rule*** requires that a fiduciary, such as a senior executives and trustee, act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent person acting in a like capacity would use. FOrmalised by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines released in 1991 provided punishment guidelines to help federal judges interpret computer crime laws.
      - Prudent actions refer to actions or decisions that are marked by a high degree of caution, care, and foresight. They are characterized by careful consideration of potential risks, a focus on preventing harm, and a commitment to acting in a manner that is consistent with established best practices or industry standards.  
  - 🍍**Computer Crime**: is any violation of a law or regulation that involves a computer. It is a computer crime if the violation involves a computer, either as the target or as a tool. There are basically three categories of crime involving computers:
      - 🚡Computer-Assisted crime where the computer could be of assistance in the commission of the crime - e.g unauthorized decryption. If the computer is of assistance in the commission of the crime, then the threat actor used the computer and its capabilities to launch the attack. For example, the computer can be used to decrypt a protected file. Without the computer, this would be very difficult to do.
      - 🚡Computer-Targeted crime where The computer could be the target of the crime e.g hacking and
      - 🚡Computer-Incidental crime where the computer could be incidental to the commission of the crime e.g using computer to save names of drug dealers partners. If the computer is incidental in the commission of the crime, then the threat actor used a computer but it was something that could have been done without a computer. For example, documenting the sales of their illicit drug trading in a Word document or spreadsheet when it could just as easily have been done on paper.

[1.4](#1.4) Determine compliance and other requirements (OSG-9 Chpt 4)
- 1.4.1 Contractual, legal, industry standards, and regulatory requirements
  - Understand the difference between criminal, civil, and administrative law.
    - 📁**Criminal law**: protects society against acts that violate the basic principles we believe in; violations of criminal law are prosecuted by federal and state governments. Criminal law is found under both the Civilist and Common legal systems. Criminal laws are created to protect the public. For example, it is illegal to beat someone up, kill them, abuse children, etc.
    - 📁**Civil law**: provides the framework for the transaction of business between people and organizations; violations of civil law are brought to the court and argued by the two affected parties
         - ✴️Civil (Tort) Law: Refers to a branch of civil law that deals with civil wrongs and legal disputes where one party claims to have been harmed by the wrongful conduct of another party. It is focused on compensating the injured party rather than punishing the wrongdoer.
         - ✴️Civil Code Law: Refers to a comprehensive set of legal rules and statutes that govern private rights and obligations in a civil law system. It is a codified system of laws that covers a broad range of legal issues including contracts, property, family law, and obligations.
         - Civil law has two interpretations.
             - 🐌Within a country under a Common legal system, it refers to the subcategory of law that is essentially lawsuits. To minimize confusion, this could be referred to as 📝tort law instead.
             - 🐌Civil law is a major category of law. It dates back to ancient Roman times. It can also be referred to as Civilist, 📝Napoleonic Code, or 📝Roman law. This is the most prevalent category of law on the planet. It is found throughout Europe, South America, many African countries, the U.S. state of Louisiana, and the Canadian province of Quebec. There is no jury in civil law, rather, the judge has the responsibility to enforce the law.
    - 📁**Administrative law**: used by government agencies to effectively carry out their day-to-day business
    	- Administrative laws do not require an act of the legislative branch to implement at the federal level. Administrative laws consist of the policies, procedures, and regulations promulgated by agencies of the executive branch of government. Although they do not require an act of Congress or an act of the legislative branch to implement at the federal level, these laws are subject to judicial review and must 🧠comply with criminal and civil laws enacted by the legislative branch. HIPAA is an example of administrative law.
     - Administrative law is a set of policies or rules specified not by a larger body of lawmakers (legislature) but by individual agencies or individuals with administrative authority. Administrative law is created by government agencies to address areas including international trade, manufacturing, the environment, and immigration. Administrative law must comply with existing civil and criminal laws and cannot contradict laws passed by the legislature. An example of this is the change of net neutrality rules in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
     - 📁**Common law**: is precedent based rather than statutes or written law.
         - ✏️Precedent: A legal principle or rule established in a previous judicial decision that is used to guide judges in deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts.
         - ✏️Stare Decisis: This is the doctrine of adhering to established precedents. It means “to stand by things decided” and ensures consistency and predictability in the law by requiring courts to follow the decisions made in earlier cases.
  - 📁**Religious laws**: are legal systems that are based on what the religion considers correct behavior. In the Middle East, Sharia law (Muslim law) is an example. Vatican City is another location where religious law is found. The pope is the head of the state because he is the head of the religion in Vatican City, which means that what is legal is up to the pope and the bible.
  - 📁**Customary law**: is also usually found in the Middle East. The customs are what is considered the law. For example, if women have never driven cars it would be illegal for them to start, simply because it has been the custom.
  - **Compliance**: Organizations may find themselves subject to a wide variety of laws, and regulations imposed by regulatory agencies or contractual obligation
    - 📙**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** - governs the security of credit card information and is enforced through the terms of a merchant agreement between a business that accepts CC payments, and the bank that processes the business' transactions.

[1.5](#1.5) Understand legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information security in a holistic context (OSG-9 Chpt 4)
- 1.5.1 Cybercrimes and data breaches
  - Understand the notification requirements placed on organizations that experience a data breach
  - California's SB 1386 implemented the first statewide requirement to notify individuals of a breach of their personnel information; all other states eventually followed suit with similar laws
  - Currently, federal law only requires notification of individuals when a HIPAA-covered entity breaches their protected health information (likely to soon change)
  - Before an org expands to other countries, perform due diligence to understand legal systems and what changes might be required to the way that data is handled and secured
  - In particular, be familiar with:
    - 📙**Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime**: a treaty signed by many countries that establishes standards for cybercrime policy 
    - Laws about data breaches, including notification requirements
    - 📙**Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)** In the US, the Act requires ✏️notification of a data breach in some cases, such as when the personal health information was not protected as required by HIPAA
    - 📙**GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)** applies to insurance and financial orgs, requiring notification to federal regulators, law enforcement agencies and customers when a ✏️data breach occurs 
    - Certain states also impose their own requirements concerning data breaches 
    - the EU and other countries have their own requirements, for instance, the GDPR has very strict data breach notification requirements: A data breach must be reported to the competent supervisory authority within 72 hours of its discovery
    - Some countries do not have any reporting requirements
- 1.5.2 Licensing and intellectual property (IP) requirements
  - 💢**Intellectual property**: ✏️intangible assets (e.g. software, data)

      - ✏️Click-wrap agreement is a type of contract where users must agree to the terms and conditions by clicking an "I agree" button or similar option before they can complete the installation or use of the software.
      - ✏️Enterprise license agreement typically allows customization of terms and pricing, reflecting the negotiated details between the vendor and a corporate client.
      - ✏️An end-user license agreement usually accompanies software to dictate the terms of use but is not designed for custom negotiations and pricing agreements.
      - The license agreement may also be written as a perpetual or subscription license
  - 💢**Trade Secrets**: intellectual property that is critical to a business, and significant damage would result if it were disclosed to competitors or the public. Trade secrets are protected as long as they remain secret. It can also protect computer software.
  - When you file application for protection, until registration is granted, you can use the 🔥**TM** symbol to inform others that it is protected under trademark law. Once the application is approved, the name becomes a registered trademark, and you can begin using the 🔥**®** R symbol. The 🔥**©** C symbol is used to represent a copyright.
- 1.5.3 Import/export controls
  -  Every country has laws around the import and export of hardware and software; e.g. the US has restrictions around the export of 🔐cryptographic technology, and Russia requires a license to import 🔐encryption technologies manufactured outside the country

[1.6](#1.6) Understand requirements for investigation types (i.e., administrative, criminal, civil, regulatory, industry standards) (OSG-9 Chpt 19)

- An investigation will vary based on incident type; e.g. for a financial services company, a financial system compromise might cause a regulatory investigation; a system breach or website compromise might cause a criminal investigation; each type of investigation has special considerations:
  - 🧯**Administrative Investigation**: an administrative investigation has a primary purpose of providing the appropriate authorities with incident information; thereafter, authorities will determine the proper action, if any 
    - Administrative investigations are often tied to HR scenarios, such as when a manager has been accused of improprieties. Unlike criminal or civil cases, administrative investigations are an internal matter, and there is no set standard of proof that you must apply.  However, it would still be wise for the organization to include a standard burden of proof in their own internal procedures to ensure the thoroughness and fairness of investigations.
  - 🧯**Criminal Investigation**: a criminal investigation occurs when a crime has been committed and you are working with a law enforcement agency to convict the alleged perpetrator; in such a case, it is common to gather evidence for a court of law, and to share the evidence with the defense
    - You need to gather and handle the information using methods that ensure the evidence can be used in court
    - In a criminal case, a suspect must be proven guilty beyond a 📝reasonable doubt📝; a higher bar compared to a civil case, which is showing a preponderance of evidence
  - 🧯**Operational investigations** are performed by internal teams to troubleshoot performance or other technical issues. They are not intended to produce evidence for use in court and, therefore, do not have the rigid collection standards of criminal, civil, or regulatory investigations. 
  - 🧯**Civil Investigation**: in a civil case, one person or entity sues another; e.g. one company could sue another for a trademark violation 
    - A civil case is typically about monetary damages, and doesn't involve criminality
    -  it relates to a contract dispute and will likely wind up being litigated in civil court
    - In a civil case, a 📝preponderance of evidence📝 is required to secure a victory; differing from criminal cases, where a suspect is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
  - 🧯**Industry Standards Investigation**: an industry standards investigation is intended to determine whether an org is adhering to a specific industry standard or set of standards, such as logging and auditing failed logon attempts 
    - Because industry standards represent well-understood and widely implemented best practices, many orgs try to adhere to them even when they are not required to do so in order to improve security, and reduce operational and other risks
  - 🧯**Regulatory Investigation**: A regulatory investigation is conducted by a regulatory body, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), against an org suspected of an infraction 
    - Here the org is required to comply with the investigation, e.g., by not hiding or destroying evidence
- **Liability:** Questions of liability often turn into questions regarding potential negligence. When attempting to determine whether certain actions or inactions constitute negligence, the ✏️Prudent Man Rule, which we will define shortly, is often applied
     - 🎈Statutory Statutory damages are those prescribed by law, which can be awarded to the victim even if the victim incurred no actual loss or injury
     - 🎈Compensatory The purpose of compensatory damages is to provide the victim with a financial award in effort to compensate for the loss or injury incurred as a direct result of the wrongdoing
     - 🎈Punitive The intent of punitive damages is to punish an individual or organization. These damages are typically awarded to attempt to discourage a particularly egregious violation where the compensatory or statutory damages alone would not act as a deterrent

[1.7](#1.7) Develop, document, and implement security policy, standards, procedures and guidelines (OSG-9 Chpt 1)
- The top tier of a formalized hierarchical organization security documentation is the security policy
  - A security policy is a formal document that defines the scope and enforcement of security within an organization. Security policies do not frequently change and generally invoke standards, procedures, and guidelines. Security documentation is the security policy.
  - 🔥**Policy**: docs created by and published by 📝senior management describing organizational strategic goals
  - A security policy is a document that defines the scope of security needed by the org, discussing assets that require protection and the extent to which security solutions should go to provide the necessary protections
  - Policies are 📝high-level documents, usually written by the management team; policies are 📝mandatory, and a policy might 📝provide requirements, but not the steps for implementation
    - A policy is a document that defines the scope of security needed by the organization and discusses the assets that require protection and the extent to which security solutions should go to provide the necessary protection.
  - It defines the 📝strategic security objectives, vision, and 📝goals and outlines the security framework of the organization
- **Acceptable User Policy**: the AUP is a commonly produced document that exists as part of the overall security documentation infrastructure 
  - This policy defines a level of acceptable performance and expectation of behavior and activity; failure to comply with the policy may result in job action warnings, penalties, or termination

- Security Standards, Baselines and Guidelines: once the main security policies are set, the remaining security docuemntation can be crafted from these policies
  - 🔥**Standards**: specific mandates explicity stating expections of performance/conformance; more descriptive than policies, standards define :compulsary requirements for the homogenous use of hardware, software, technology, and security controls, uniformly implemented throughout the org. It could be internal or external.
    - A standard defines compulsory requirements for the homogenous use of hardware, software, technology, and security controls.
    - Standards are 📝Mandatory
    - A standard describes the specific use of technology, often applied to hardware and software. “All employees will receive an ACME Nexus-6 laptop with 8 GB of memory, a 3.3 GHZ quad core central processing unit (CPU), and 500-gigabyte disk” is an example of a hardware standard. “The laptops will run Windows 10 Enterprise, 64-bit version” is an example of a software (operating system) standard.
  - 🔥**Baseline**: defines a 📝minimum level of security that every system throughout the organization must meet; baselines are usually 📝system specific and refer to industry / government standards. It is often related to configuration. 
    - A baseline is a more operationally focused form of a standard.
    - e.g. a baseline for  server builds would be a list of configuration areas that should be applied to every server that is built
    - Baselines are 📝semi-Mandatory and discretionary. All systems not complying with the baseline should be taken out of production until they can be brought up to the baseline.
    - A Group Policy Object (GPO) in a Windows network is sometimes used to comply with standards; configuration management solutions can also help you establish baselines and spot configurations that are not in alignment
  - 🔥**Guideline**: offers 📝recommendations and best practices on how standards and baselines and other security requirements should be implemented & serves as an operational guide for security professionals and users 
    - Guidelines are flexible, and can be customized for unique systems or conditions; they state which security mechanism should be deployed instead of prescribing a specific product or control; they are not complusory; suggested practices and expectations of activity to best accomplish tasks and goals
    - **Framework** are a set of guidlines
  - 🔥**Procedure** (AKA Standard Operating Procedure or SOP): detailed, 📝step-by-step how-to doc that describes the exact actions necessary to implement a specific security mechanism, control, or solution. Procedures are 📝Mandatory
  - 🔥**Laws** Legal rules created by government entities e.g legislature. Must be followed or can result in civil or criminal penalties
  - 🔥**Regulations** rules created by governmental agencies. Must be followed or can result in civil or criminal penalties

[1.7.2](#1.7.2) External Dependencies (New in 2024)
Factors, entities or conditions outside the organisation upon which the organisations business continutiy plans and operation resilience may depend. EG suppliers, vendors, utilities, transportation. Do not rely on one supply that may be affected by the same disaster.

[1.8](#1.8) Identify, analyze, and prioritize Business Continuity (BC) requirements (OSG-9 Chpt 3)

- ❄️**Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**: involves assessing the risk to organizational processes and creating policies, plans, and procedures to minimize the impact those risks might have on the organization if they were to occur
  - BCP is used to maintain the 📝continuous operation of a business in the event of an emergency, with a goal to implement a combination of policies, procedures, and processes
  - Business continuity requires a lot of planning and preparation; actual implementation of business continuity processes occur quite infrequently
  - Individuals with specific business continuity roles should receive training on at least an ✴️annual basis.
  - Everyone in the organization should receive basic training on the nature and scope of the business continuity program. Those with specific roles, such as first responders and senior executives, should also receive detailed, role-specific training.
  - The safety of ✴️people/human life must always be the paramount concern in business continuity planning. 
  - business organization analysis is the first step of the process, and the results are used to aid in the selection of team members and the design of the BCP process.
  - The primary facets of business continuity are:
    - ⚒️Resilience: (e.g. within a data center and between sites or data centers) 
    - ⚒️Recovery: if a service becomes unavailable, you need to recover it as soon as possible
    - ⚒️Contingency: a last resort in case resilience and recovery prove ineffective
- Following are the steps for BCP:
    - 🥑Project initiation: Develop policy statement and document
    - 🥑Scope/Planning: The project scope and planning phase includes four actions: a structured analysis of the organization, the creation of a BCP team, an assessment of available resources, and an analysis of the legal and regulatory landscape. Initiation of the plan, Final approval of the plan, Demonstration of due care and due diligence to the satisfaction of management.  The most significant resource utilization will be the time dedicated by members of the BCP team to the planning process i.e personnel.
    - 🥑Business impact analysis: Identify critical assets, Conduct risk assessment, Determine maximum tolerable downtime (MTD), Failure and recovery metrics
    - 🥑Identify preventive control
    - 🥑Recovery strategy: Supply chain management (acquisition of computer equipment is assured during disaster), Telecommunication management (availability of electronic communication during disaster), Utility management (Availability of utilities like power, gas, water, etc.) Also develop an IT contingency plan.
    - 🥑️Designing and development: approval
    - 🥑Implementation, training, and testing
    - 🥑BCP maintenance: Change management, Version control, Accounting for mistakes
- NIST SP800-34 provides a guideline for developing a logical BCP. It can be found at: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-34-rev1/sp800-34-rev1_errata-Nov11-2010.pdf
- In summary, the core steps of planning for business continuity issues or disasters are:
    - 🍊Policy
    - 🍊Project scope and planning
    - 🍊Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
    - 🍊Continuity planning
    - 🍊Implementation and Testing
  
- BCP vs DR: 
  - 🔥BCP activities are typically strategically focused at a high level and center themselves on business processes and operations. E.g 📝RAID technology provides fault tolerance for hard drive failures and is an example of a business continuity action. 
  - 🔥DR plans tend to be more tactical and describe technical activities such as recovery sites, backups, and fault tolerance. It ensures sufficient technical controls in place to recover operations after a disruption. Ensures that the organization has sufficient technical controls in place to recover operations after a disruption. Disaster recovery plans pick up where business continuity plans leave off. After a disaster strikes and the business is interrupted, the disaster recovery plan guides response teams in their efforts to quickly restore business operations to normal levels. 📝Restoring from backup tapes, 📝relocating to a cold site, and 📝restarting business operations are all disaster recovery actions.

- The overall goal of BCP is to provide a quick, calm, and efficient response in the event of an emergency and to enhance a company's ability to quickly recover from a distruptive event
- 📝The emergency response guidelines should include the immediate steps an organization should follow in response to an emergency situation. These include immediate response procedures, a list of individuals who should be notified of the emergency, and secondary response procedures for first responders
- 🚒Business continuity plan documentation normally includes the
    - continuity planning goals
    - a statement of importance
    - statement of priorities
    - statement of organizational responsibility
    - statement of urgency and timing
    - risk assessment and risk acceptance and mitigation documentation
    - a vital records program
    - emergency response guidelines
    - and documentation for maintaining and testing the plan.

- 1.8.2 Develop and document the scope and the plan
  - The BCP process has four main steps (Project scope and planning, Business Impact Analysis, Continuity planning, and Approval and implementation):
    - 🔴**Project scope and planning**: Developing the project scope and plan starts with gaining support of the management team, making a business case (cost/benefit analysis, regulatory or compliance reasons etc.) and gaining approval to move forward. 
      - Next, you need to form a team with representatives from the business as well as IT. This will require an initial analysis of the Business organization to aid in the selection of team members
      - Next, start with a business continuity policy statement, then conduct a business impact analysis (see next item), and then develop the remaining components: 
        - preventive controls
        - relocation
        - the actual continuity plan 
        - testing
        - training and maintenance
- 1.8.1 Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
    - 🔴**Business impact analysis (BIA)**:
        - ⚒️Phase 1: Identification of priorities
        - ⚒️Phase 2: Risk identification
        - ⚒️Phase 3: Likelihood assessment
        - ⚒️Phase 4: Resource prioritization.
    - Identify the systems and services that the business relies on and assess the impacts that a disruption or outage would cause, including the impacts on business processes like accounts receivable and sales. This should be the first step i.e identify the business's priorities
      - Also decide which systems and services you need to get things running again (think foundational IT services such as the network and directory, which many other systems rely on)
      - The “business impact” asset valuation method involves evaluating the potential impact on the organization’s operations, reputation, or bottom line if the asset is compromised. The other options correspond to different asset valuation methods: “✏️financial value,” “✏️market value,” and “✏️intangible value,” respectively.
      - Finally, prioritize the order in which critical systems and services are recovered or brought back online. 
      - As part of the BIA, establish:
        - **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)** (how long it takes to recover) The maximum acceptable amount of time that a system, application, or function can be down after a failure or disaster. The goal of business continuity planning exercises is to reduce the amount of time required to restore operations. This is done by minimizing the recovery time objective (RTO). 📝An acceptable RTO must be less than MTD.
        - **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)** (the maximum tolerable data loss/maximum amount of time for which loss of data is acceptable)
        - **Mean time to Failure (MTTF)**: is the expected typical functional lifetime of the device given a specific operating environment.
        - **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** The predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a system during operation. e.g A server might have an MTBF of 10,000 hours.
        - **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)** The average time required to repair a failed component or system.
        - **Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD)**, (how long an org can survive an interruption of critical functions) along with the costs of downtime and recovery; AKA MTD (maximum tolerable downtime). This measure is sometimes also called ✴️maximum tolerable outage (MTO) or ✴️maximum allowable downtime (MAD)
        - Some mitigation actions during BIA include:
        - ✏️Hardening systems:  securing systems by reducing their attack surface of vulnerability
        - ✏️Defining systems: identifying and describing the various systems within an organization, including their roles, functions, and interdependencies.
        - ✏️Reducing systems: Consolidation and removal of complexity
        - ✏️Alternative systems: refers to backup systems, redundant systems 
    - 🔴**Continuity planning**: The first two phases of the BCP process (project scope and planning and the business impact analysis) focus on determining how the BCP process will work and prioritizing the business assets that need to be protected against interruption
      - The next phase of BCP development, continuity planning, focuses on the development and implementation of a continuity strategy to minimize the impact realized risks might have on protected assets
      - There are two primary subtasks involved in continuity planning:
        - Strategy development
        - Provisions and processes: In the provisions and processes phase, the BCP team also designs the procedures and mechanisms to mitigate risks that were deemed unacceptable during the strategy development phase.
      - The goal of this process is to create a **continuity of operations plan** (COOP), which focuses on how an org will carry out critical business functions starting shortly after a disruption occurs and extending up to one month of sustained operations
    - 🔴**Approval and implementation**:
      - BCP plan now needs sr. management buy-in (should be endorsed by the org's top exec)
      - You should strive to have the highest-­ranking person possible sign the BCP’s statement of importance.
      - BCP team should create an implementation schedule, and all personnel involed should receive training on the plan

- The top priority of BCP and DRP is people: **Always prioritize people's safety**; get people out of harm's way, and then address IT recovery and restoration issues

[1.9](#1.9) Contribute to and enforce personnel security policies and procedures (OSG-9 Chpt 2)

- People are often considered the weakest element in any security solution; no matter what physical or logical controls are deployed, humans can discover ways of to avoid them, circumvent/subvert them, or disable them 
  - Malicious actors are routinely targeting users with phishing and spear phishing campaigns, social engineering, and other types of attacks, and everybody is a target
  - Once attackers compromise an account, they can use that entry point to move around the network and elevate their privileges 
  - People can also become a key security asset when they are properly trained and are motivated to protect not only themselves but the security of the organization as well

- 1.9.1 Candidate screening and hiring
  - The following strategies can reduce your risk:
    - 🍏**Candidate screening and hiring**: To properly plan for security, you shold have standards in place for job descriptions, job classification, work tasks, job responsibilities, prevention of collusion, candidate screening, background checks, security clearances, employment agreements, and nondisclosure agreements 
      - ⭐Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) typically require either mutual or one-way confidentiality in a business relationship.
      - ⭐Noncompete agreements (NCAs) limit the future employment possibilities of employees by restricting an employee’s ability to work with or start a competing business for a certain period after leaving the organization. 📝Signing a noncompete or nondisclosure agreement is typically done at hiring.
      - screening employment candidates thoroughly is a key part of the hiring process
      - be sure to conduct a full background check that includes a criminal records check, job history verification, education verification, certification validation and confirmation of other accolades when possible
      - all references should be contacted
- 1.9.2 Employement agreements and policies
  - 🍏**Employment agreement**: specifies job duties, expectations, rate of pay, benefits and info about termination; sometimes, such agreements are for a set period (for example, in a contract or short-term job). 
    - Employment agreements facilitate termination when needed for an underperforming employee 
    - The more info and detail in an employment agreement, the less risk (risk of a wrongful termination lawsuit, for example) the company has during a termination proceeding
    - e.g. a terminated employee might take a copy of their email with them without thinking of it as stealing, but they are less likely to do so if an employment agreement or another policy document clearly prohibits it
    - example employee agreements:
      - non-compete 
      - codes of conduct such as an acceptable use policy (AUP), which defines what is and isn’t acceptable acitivty, practice, or use for company equipemnt and resources
      - nondisclosure agreement (NDA), which is a doc used to protect confidential information from being disclosed by a current or former employee
- 1.9.3 Onboarding, transfers and termination processes   
  - 🍏**Onboarding**: process of bringing a new employee into the org
    - creating documented processes allowing the new employee to be intgrated quickly and consistently
  - 🍏**Transfer**: an employee moves from one job to another, likely requiring adjusted account access to maintain appropriate least privilege
  - 🍏**Termination or offboarding**: offboarding is the removal of an employee's identity from the IAM system, once that person has left the org; can also be an element used when an employee transfers into a new role
    - whether cordial or abrupt, the ex-employee should be escorted off the premises and not allowed to return
    - In the case of an involuntary termination under adverse circumstances, the user is being fired and may have a negative and potentially hostile reaction. For this reason, it is important to terminate access immediately upon the user being informed of the termination. Terminating access prior to notification may tip the user off to the termination in advance.
- 1.9.4 Vendor, consultant, and contractor agreements and controls
  - Orgs commonly outsource many IT functions, particularly data center hosting, contact-center support, and application development
  - Info security policies and procedures must address outsourcing secuity and the use of service providers, vendors and consultants 
    - e.g. access control, document exchange and review, maintenance, on-site assessment, process and policy review, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are examples of outsourcing security considerations
- 1.9.5 Compliance policy requirements
    - **Compliance**: the act of confirming or adhering to rules, policies, regulations, standards, or requirements
      - on a personnel level, compliance is related to individual employees following company policies and procedures
      - employees need to be trained on company standards as defined in the security policy and remain in compliance with any contractual obligations (e.g. with PCI DSS)
    - Compliacne is a form of administrative or managerial security control. 📝Note adminsitratice controls can also include hiring and firing policies, data classifications and labels, and security awareness and training
    - **Compliance enforcement**: the application of sanctions or consequences for failing to follow policy, training, best practices, or regulations
- 1.9.6 Privacy policy requirements    
    - Personally identifiable information (PII) about employees, partners, contractors, customers and others should be stored in a secure way, accessible only to those who require the information to perform their jobs
    - Orgs should maintain a documented privacy policy outlining the type of data covered by the policy and who the policy applies to 
    - Employees and contractors should be required to read and agree to the privacy policy upon hire and on a regular basis thereafter (such as annually)

[1.10](#1.10) Understand and apply risk management concepts (OSG-9 Chpt 2)
- 1.10.1 Privacy policy requirements
  - **Threats**: any potential occurrence that many cause an undersirable or unwanted outome for a specific asset; they can be intentional or accidental; loosely think of a threat as a weapon that could cause harm to a target
  - **Vulnerability**: the weakness in an asset, or weakness (or absense) of a safeguard or countermeasure; a flaw, limitation, error, frailty, or susceptibility to harm
  - Threats and vulnerabilities are related: a threat is possible when a vulnerability is present
    - Threats exploit vulnerabilities, which results in exposure 
    - Exposure is risk, and risk is mitigated by safeguards 
    - Safeguards protect assets that are endangered by threats
  - **Risk**: the possiblity or likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset and the severity of damage that could result; the > the potential harm, the > the risk
- 1.10.1 Risk assessment/analysis
  - 📁**Risk Assessment**: used to identify the risks and set criticality priorities, and then risk response is used to determine the best defense for each identified risk
      - The primary goal of a security risk assessment is to identify and analyze risks and then develop strategies to reduce them to an acceptable level.
      - It also involves assigning an asset value using valuation methods such as Purchase cost, Depreciated cost, Replacement cost etc if the risk where to materialize.
      - A risk matrix or risk heat map is a form of risk assessment that is performed on a basic graph or chart
      - Likelihood assessment is a component of a risk assessment that determines the likelihood that a risk will materialize
  - **❄️Risk** is threat with a vulnerability. Risk is the possibility or likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset and the severity of damage that could result. Risk is commonly defined with two keywords: likelihood or probability and impact or consequence. Risk management is used to reduce risk. Before any security policies are made, risk must always be defined and assessed within the organization.
       - 💥**NIST SP 80-137** NIST defines risk in many different documents that are all very similar. NIST SP 80-137 defines risk as, "A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of:
           - ⚒️the adverse IMPACTS that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and
           - ⚒️the LIKELIHOOD of occurrence."
       - ✏️Risk = threat * vulnerability (or probability of harm * severity of harm)
       - ✏️Risk is a calculation of the 📝probability of occurrence and the level of damage that could be caused if an exposure is realized (i.e., actually occurs).
       - ✏️Risk is presence of a vulnerability when a related threat exists
       - Addressing either the threat or threat agent or vulnerability directly results in a reduction of risk (known as threat mitigation)
       - All IT systems have risk; all orgs have risk; there is no way to elminiate 100% of all risks. Risk is typically composed of three Components:
  - **❄️Threat** (a potential cause of an incident that may result in harm). A threat is defined by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as any circumstance or event that can negatively impact a corporation's mission, operations, function, mission, etc.
       - A threat is something that could cause damage, alteration, loss, disclosure, etc. It is something that will impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
       - ✏️Threats: Any potential occurrence that may cause an undesirable or unwanted outcome for an organization or for a specific asset is a threat.
       - ✏️Threat agents or threat actors: Entities that intentionally exploit vulnerabilities.
       - ✏️Threat events: Accidental occurrences and intentional exploitations of vulnerabilities.
       - ✏️Threat vector: The path or means by which an attack or attacker can gain access to a target in order to cause harm. 
  - **❄️Vulnerability** (a weakness that can be exploited by a threat).
      - It is the weakness in an asset, or the absence or the weakness of a safeguard or countermeasure.
      - A vulnerability is a flaw, loophole, oversight, error, limitation, frailty, or susceptibility in the IT infrastructure or any other process.
      - A vulnerability is a weakness within the systems or procedures that can be exploited by the threat actor to cause damage.
      - Vulnerabilities and risks are evaluated based on their threats against one or more of the CIA Triad principles. 📝The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a standardized approach to rating the severity of vulnerabilities 
  - **❄️Impact** (the potential harm caused by a threat exploiting a vulnerability)
  - **❄️Exposure**: Exposure is defined by NIST as the extent to which an organization is subject to risk. Exposures are when an asset is susceptible to a threat. If there is no exposure, there is no threat to deal with. Exposure means being susceptible to asset loss because of a threat; the potential for harm to occur. The quantitative risk analysis value of exposure factor (EF) is derived from this concept. Exposure is a term used in risk to explain how much of the data/system/corporation is at risk.
  - **❄️Breach**: A breach is a security event that results in the actual or potential disclosure of protected information. In this case, credit card data was stolen and sold in an unauthorized manner.
  - 🔴**Risk analysis** identifies risks, quantifies the impact of threats, and aids in budgeting for security. It helps integrate the needs and objectives of the security policy with the organization's business goals and intentions. The risk analysis/risk assessment is a "point in time" metric, meaning Security is always changing thus continuous improvement is required.
       - Risk analysis includes analyzing an environment for risks
       - evaluating each threat event as to its likelihood of occurring and the cost of the damage it would cause
       - assessing the cost of various countermeasures for each risk, and creating a cost/benefit report for safeguards to present to upper management. 
  - It is the responsibility of upper management must decide which risks are acceptable, and which are not; Selecting safeguards is a task of upper management based on the results of risk analysis known as risk response.
  - There are two primary risk-assessment methodologies:
      - 📕**Quantitative Risk Analysis**: assigns real dollar figures to the loss of an asset and is based on mathematical calculations e.g ✏️FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) is a quantitative risk management framework. Quantitative analysis uses numeric ratings to address tangible risks. A purely quantitative analysis is not possible.
          - Quantitative risk analysis assigns a 📝monetary value to assets. 
      - 📕**Qualitative Risk Analysis**: assigns subjective and intangible values to the loss of an asset and takes into account perspectives, feelings, intuition, preferences, ideas, and gut reactions. It relies on subjective judgments to rank risk. The use of a ⭐probability/impact matrix is the hallmark of a qualitative risk assessment. It uses 📝subjective measures of probability and impact, such as "high" and "low," in place of quantitative measures. qualitative risk assessment is a good tool for 📝intangible risks
      - Qualitative tools are often used in business impact assessment to capture the impact on intangible factors such as customer confidence, employee morale, and reputation.
      - Example include qualititiva analysis tools include the Delphi method or Delphi technique, Risk Matrix (Probability/Impact Matrix), SWOT Analysis, Brainstorming, Cause-and-Effect Analysis (Ishikawa/Fishbone Diagram), Scenario Analysis, checklists.
      - Qualitative risk analysis generally does not assign monetary values to assets. Qualitative risk analysis is generally used when a monetary value cannot be assigned.
      - Qualitative risk analysis gives risk scores based on input from multiple parties and the assessor's experience and expertise. 
    - Most orgs employ a hybrid of both risk assessment methodologies
    - The goal of risk assessment is to identify risks (based on asset-threat parings) and rank them in order of criticality
    - The two most important elements of a qualitative risk assessment are determining the 📝probability and 📝impact of each risk upon the organization. Likelihood is another word for probability.

- 1.10.3 Risk response
  - **Risk response**: the formulation of a plan for each identified risk;
  - Risk response involves evaluating countermeasures, safeguards, and security controls using a cost/benefit analysis; adjusting findings based on other conditions, concerns, priorities, and resources; and providing a proposal of response options in a report to senior management
  - for a given risk, you have a choice for a possible risk response:
    - 💥**Risk Mitigation**: reducing risk, or risk mitigation, is the implementation of safeguards, security controls, and countermeasures to reduce and/or eliminate vulnerabilities or block threats. Risk mitigation strategies attempt to lower the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring. Intrusion prevention systems attempt to reduce the probability of a successful attack and are, therefore, examples of risk mitigation.
    - 💥**Risk Assignment**: assigning or transferring risk is the placement of the responsibility of loss due to a risk onto another entity or organization; AKA assignment of risk and transference of risk. ❄️Insurance is a form of risk assignment or transference
    - 💥**Risk perspectives**, also known as risk management perspectives or approaches, are different lenses through which organizations and individuals can view
    - 💥**Risk Deterrence**: deterrence is the process of implementing deterrents for would-be violators of security and policy 
      - the goal is to convince a threat agent not to attack; 
      - e.g. implementing auditing, security cameras, and warning banners; using security guards
    - 💥**Risk Avoidance**: Risk avoidance alters business activities to make a risk irrelevant. determining that the impact or likelihood of a specific risk is too greate to be offset by potential benefits, and not performing a particular business function due to that determiniation; the process of selecting alternate options or activities that have less associated risk than the default, common, expedient, or cheap option
    - 💥**Risk Acceptance**: the result after a cost/benefit analysis determines that countermeasure costs would outweigh the possible cost of loss due to a risk 
      - also means that management has agreed to accept the consequences/loss if the risk is realized
      - For acceptable risks, the documentation should include a rationale for that decision and a list of potential future events that might warrant a reconsideration of that determination. The documentation would not include controls used to mitigate acceptable risks, since acceptable risks do not require mitigation.
    - 💥**Risk Rejection**: an unacceptable possible response to risk is to reject risk or ignore risk; denying that risk exists and hoping that it will never be realized are not valid prudent due care/due diligence responses to risk
    - 💥**Risk Transference**: paying an external party to accept the financial impact of a given risk
  - **Inherent Risk**: the level of natural, native, or default risk that exists in an environment, system, or product prior to any risk management efforts being performed (AKA ✴️initial or starting risk); this is the risk identified by the risk assessment process
  - **Residual Risk**: consists of threats to specific assets against which management chooses not to implement (the risk that management has chosen to accept rather than mitigate); risk remaining after security controls have been put in place
  - **Total Risk**: the amount of risk an org would face if no safeguards were implemented
  - **Conceptual Total Risk Formula**: threats * vulnerabilities * asset value = total risk
  - **Controls Gap**: amount of risk that is reduced by implementing safeguards
  - **Conceptual Residual Risk Formula**: total risk - controls gap = residual risk
  - Risk should be reassessed on a periodic basis to maintain reasonable security because security changes over time
- 1.10.4 Countermeasure selection and implementation
  - **Countermeasure**: AKA a "control" or "safeguard" can help reduce risk
    - For exam prep, understand how the concepts are integrated into your environment; this is not a step-by-step technical configuration, but the process of the implementation — where you start, in which order it occurs and how you finish
    - ⭐When developing an organization's information security budget, it is important that the  expected risk can be managed appropriately with the funds allocated.
    - ⭐The annual costs of safeguards should not exceed the expected annual cost of asset value loss.
    - ⭐The result of the applied countermeasure should make the cost of an attack greater for the perpetrator than the derived benefit from an attack;
    - ⭐The countermeasure should provide a solution to a real and identified problem;
    - ⭐The benefit of the countermeasure should be testable and verifiable. 
    - Bear in mind that security should be designed to support and enable business tasks and functions
      - security controls, countermeasures, and safeguards can be implemented administratively, logically / technically, or physically 
      - these 3 categories should be implemented in a conceptual layered defense-in-depth manner to provide maximum benefit
      - based on the concept that policies (part of administrative controls) drive all aspects of security and thus form the initial protection layer around assets
      - ❄️**Defense in depth** is simply the use of multiple controls in a series. No one control can protect against all possible threats. Using a multilayered solution allows for numerous, different controls to guard against whatever threats come to pass.
      - Defense in depth states that organizations should have overlapping security controls designed to meet the same security objectives whenever possible. This approach provides security in the event of a single control failure.
      - Some of the terms that relate to or are based on defense in depth include:
          - 🎈Layering
          - 🎈Classifications
          - 🎈Zones
          - 🎈Realms
          - 🎈Compartments
          - 🎈Silos
          - 🎈Segmentations
          - 🎈Lattice structure
          - 🎈Protection rings
      - then, logical and technical controls provide protection against logical attacks and exploits 
      - then, physical controls provide protection against real-world physical attacks against facilities and devices
- 1.10.5 Applicable types of controls (e.g., preventive, detective, corrective)
  - **🔥Administrative**: the policies and procedures defined by an org's security policy and other regulations or requirements. Administrative controls are sometimes referred to as management controls. They are the policies or procedures defined by an organization's security program. Administrative controls include hiring processes, background checks, data classification requirements, data labeling, security awareness, and training.
  - **🔥Physical**: security mechanisms focused on providing protection to the facility and real world objects
  - **🔥Preventive**: a preventive or preventative control is deployed to thwart or stop unwanted or unauthorized activity from occurring
  - **🔥Deterrent**: a deterrent control is deployed to discourage security policy violations; deterrent and preventative controls are similar, but deterrent controls often depend on individuals being convinced not to take an unwanted action
  - **🔥Detective**: a detective control is deployed to discover or detect unwanted or unauthorized activity; detective controls operate after the fact
  - **🔥Compensating**: a compensating control is deployed to provide various options to other existing controls, to aid in enforcement and support of security policies
    - they can be any controls used in addition to, or in place of, another control
    - they can be a means to improve the effectiveness of a primary control or as the alternative or failover option in the event of a primary control failure
    - example Compensation controls are used when controls like the locks in this example are not sufficient. and then placing a signs on the doors reminding staff that leaving the door open creates a security issue, and an alarm that will sound if the doors are left open for more than five minutes.
  - **🔥Corrective**: a corrective control modifies the environment to return systems to normal after an unwanted or unauthorized activity as occurred; it attempts to correct any problems resulting from a security incident
  - **🔥Recovery**: An extension of corrective controls but have more advanced or complex abilities; a recovery control attempts to repair or restore resources, functions, and capabilities after a security policy violation 
    - recovery controls typically address more significant damaging events compared to corrective controls, especially when security violations may have occurred
  - **🔥Directive**: A directive control is deployed to direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force or encourage compliance with security policies. Notifications and procedures like the signs posted at doors for are examples of directive access controls.
  - These access control types can fall into one of three categories: administrative, technical, or physical.
       - 1. Administrative (also called directive) controls are implemented by creating and following organizational policy, procedure, or regulation. User training and awareness also fall into this category.
         2. Technical controls (Logical Controls) are implemented using software, hardware, or firmware that restricts logical access on an IT system. Examples include firewalls, routers, encryption, etc.
         3. Physical controls are implemented with physical devices, such as locks, fences, gates, and security guards.
  - 🔥Security through obscurity attempts to hide the details of security controls to add security to them
- 1.10.6 Control assessments (security and privacy)
  - Periodically assess security and privacy controls: what’s working, what isn’t 
    - As part of this assessment, the existing documents should be thoroughly reviewed, and some of the controls tested randomly 
    - A report is typically produced to show the outcomes and enable the org to remediate deficiencies 
    - Often, security and privacy control assessment are performed and/or validated by different teams, with the privacy team handling the privacy aspects
- 1.10.7 Monitoring and measurement
  - Monitoring and measurement are closely aligned with identifying risks 
  - While monitoring is used for more than security purposes, monitoring should be tuned to ensure the org is notified about potential security incidents as soon as possible 
  - If a security breach occurs, monitored systems and data become valuable from a forensics perspective; rrom the ability to derive root cause of an incident to making adjustments to minimize the chances of reoccurance 
- 1.10.8 Reporting
  - 🔥Risk Reporting is a key task to perform at the conclusion of risk analysis (i.e. production and presentation of a summarizing report). Risk reporting involves the production of a risk report and a presentation of that report to the interested/relevant parties
  - 🔥A Risk Register or Risk Log is a document that inventories all identified risks to an org or system or within an individual project. 
    - A risk register is used to record and track the activities of risk management, including:
      - identifying risks
      - evaluating the severity of, and prioritizing those risks
      - prescribing responses to reduce or eliminate the risks
      - track the progress of risk mitigation
- 1.10.9 Continuous improvement (e.g., Risk maturity modeling)
  - Risk analysis is performed to provide upper management with the details necessary to decide which risks should be mitigated, which should be transferred, which should be deterred, which should be avoided, and which should be accepted
  - Effective risk communication and reporting should be clear, timely, and consistent.
  - An **Enterprise Risk Management** (ERM) program can be evaluated using an RMM 
  - **Risk Maturity Model (RMM)**: 🟡APDIO. RMM assesses the key indicators and activities of a mature, sustainable, and repeatable risk management process, typically relating the assessment of risk maturity against a five-level model such as:
    - **🔢Ad hoc**: a chaotic starting point from which all orgs initiate risk management
    - **🔢Preliminary**: loose attempts are made to follow risk management processes, but each department may perform risk assessment uniquely
    - **🔢Defined**: a common or standardized risk framework is adopted organization-wide
    - **🔢Integrated**: risk management operations are integrated into business processes, metrics are used to gather effectiveness data, and risk is considered an element in business strategy decisions
    - **🔢Optimized**: risk management focuses on achieving objectives rather than just reacting to external threats; increased strategic planning is geared toward business success rather than just avoiding incidents; and lessons learned are re-integrated into the risk management process
- 1.10.10 Risk frameworks **Focuses on the 📝WHY**
  - A risk framework is a guide or recipe for how risk is to be accessed, resolved, and monitored
  - provide a structured approach to identifying, assessing, prioritizing and manging risk to guide decision making
  - provides the overaching structure for making risk informed decisions
  - NIST established the **Risk Management Framework** (RMF) and the **Cybersecurity Framework** (CSF): the CSF is a set of guidelines for mitigating organizational cybersecurity risks, based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices. 🔥CSF is aimed at ✏️private (commercial) businesses,  critical infrastructure and commercial organizations, and purely optional. 🔥RMF's audience is ✏️federal government agencies and is mandatory for those to which it applies.
  - 📂**Risk management** facilitates the balance of operational and economic costs of protective measures with gains in mission capability.  Risk management is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks to organizational operations, assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of information systems and the information processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems.
       - It involves evaluating the likelihood and impact of risks and implementing cost-effective measures to reduce them to an acceptable level.
       - By considering the costs of implementing protective measures against the benefits of mission capability, risk management helps organizations make informed decisions about how to allocate their resources to achieve their security goals. Performance testing, security audit, and risk assessment are all important components of a risk management program.
       - Risk management is composed of two primary elements: risk assessment and risk response
            - 🍎Risk assessment or risk analysis is the examination of an environment for risks, evaluating each threat event as to its likelihood of occurring and the severity of the damage it would cause if it did occur, and assessing the cost of various countermeasures for each risk.
            - 🍎Risk response is evaluation of countermeasures, safeguards, and security controls using a cost/benefit analysis; adjusting findings based on other conditions, concerns, priorities, and resources; and providing a proposal of response options in a report to senior management;
            - 🍎Risk awareness is the effort to increase the knowledge of risks within an organization.
       - ✴️**Key risk indicators (KRIs)** are often used to monitor risk for organizations that establish an ongoing risk management program. It 📝does not Provide real-time incident response information. Monitoring and detection systems like IPS, SIEM, and other tools are better suited to handling actual attacks. Using 🍎automated data gathering and tools that allow data to be digested and summarized, KRIs can
            - 🍎provide predictive information about how organizational risks are changing. It can 🍎Provide warnings before issues occur
            - 🍎Provide historical views of past incidents
            - 🍎Provide insight into risk tolerance for the organization.

[1.11](#1.11) Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies (OSG-9 Chpt 1)
- ❄️**Threat Modeling**: security process where potential threats are identified, categorized, and analyzed; can be performed as a proactive measure during design and development or as an reactive measure once a product has been deployed   
  - Threat modeling identifies the potential harm, the probability of occurrence, the priority of concern, and the means to eradicate or reduce the threat
    - 🔥Proactive Approach: This is a proactive approach to threat modeling, which is also known as the ❄️defensive approach.  Defensive approach to threat modeling takes place during the early stages of development; the method is based on predicting threats and designing in specific defenses during the coding and crafting process
  - Security solutions are more cost effective in this phase than later; this concept should be considered a proactive approach to threat management. During the early stages of systems development, the team considers the vulnerabilities, threats, and risks of their solution and integrates protections against unwanted outcomes.
    - 🔥Reactive approach or adversarial approach to threat modeling takes place after a product has been created and deployed. Threat hunting usually happens at this stage.
- 🔴**Security Development Lifecycle** (SDL): Microsoft uses the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) with the motto: "Secure by ✴️design, secure by ✴️default, secure in ✴️deployment and ✴️communication" (also known as 🟡SD3+C)
  - It has two objectives:
    - Reduce the number of security-related design and coding defects
    - Reduce the severity of any remaining defects
- 🔴**STRIDE threat model**: Microsoft developed the STRIDE threat model: Also useful for 📝threat categorization during aplication threat modeling
  - ✏️Spoofing: an attack with the goal of gaining access to a target system through the use of falsified identity
  - ✏️Tampering: any action resulting in unauthorized changes or manipulation of data, whether in transit or in storage
  - ✏️Repudiation: the ability of a user or attacker to deny having performed an action or activity by maintaining plausible deniability
  - ✏️Information Disclosure: the revelation or distribution of private, confidential, or controlled information to external or unauthorized entities
  - ✏️Denial of Service (DoS): an attack that attempts to prevent authorized use of a resource; this can be done through flaw exploitation, connection overloading, or traffic flooding
  - ✏️Elevation of privilege: an attack where a limited user account is transformed into an account with greater privileges, powers, and access
- 🔴**Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA)**: PASTA is a risk-­centric approach that aims at selecting or developing 📝countermeasures in relation to the 📝value of the assets to be protected. A seven-stage threat modeling methodology: _(🟡Our Technical Application Tackles Vulnerabilities And Risks)_
  - ✏️Stage I: Definition of the Objectives (DO) for the Analysis of Risk
  - ✏️Stage II: Definition of the Technical Scope (DTS)
  - ✏️Stage III: Application Decomposition and Analysis (ADA)
  - ✏️Stage IV: Threat Analysis (TA)
  - ✏️Stage V: Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis (WVA)
  - ✏️Stage VI: Attack Modeling and Simulation (AMS)
  - ✏️Stage VII: Risk Analysis and Management (RAM)
- Each stage of PASTA has a specific list of objectives to achieve and deliverables to produce in order to complete the stage
- 🔴**DREAD**: The DREAD model, developed in 2002, is a quantitative risk analysis model that involves rating the severity of security threats by assigning numeric values (typically from 1 to 10) that represent different 📝levels of severity. DREAD classifies threats based on the Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability of a threat.
     - ✏️Damage: What is the total amount of damage the threat is capable of causing to your business?
     - ✏️Reproducibility: How easily can an attack on the particular threat be replicated?
     - ✏️Exploitability: How much effort is required for the threat to be exploited by an attacker?
     - ✏️Affected users: How many people, either inside or outside of your organization, will be affected by the security threat?
     - ✏️Discoverability: How easily can the vulnerability be found?
 - 🔴**MITRE's ATT&CK framework** is broadly adopted by threat modeling and threat intelligence organizations and is used as a default model in many software packages and tools.
 - ATT&CK is used to map out and understand adversarial behaviors and techniques, allowing organizations to improve detection and response capabilities based on 📝known attack methods.
 - It is a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations and using 📝pre-existing tools. It includes:
     - ✏️Tactics: The goals of an adversary during an attack (e.g., Initial Access, Execution, Persistence).
     - ✏️Techniques: Specific methods used to achieve tactics (e.g., Phishing, PowerShell).
  - 🔴**The Diamond Model** specifically addresses how to think about intrusions but does not address broader threats, and the other answers were made up for this question. The Diamond Model focuses on four key elements that interact with each other to create a threat scenario: i.e Adversary to Infrastructure, Adversary to Capability, Infrastructure to Capability, and Victim to Capability.
      - ✏️Adversary: The entity or individual initiating the attack.
      - ✏️Infrastructure: The systems, tools, or networks used by the adversary to conduct the attack.
      - ✏️Capability: The techniques, tools, or methods used by the adversary to exploit vulnerabilities and achieve their goals.
      - ✏️Victim: The target of the attack, which could be a person, organization, system, or data.
- 🔴**Threat Representation, Intelligence, and Knowledge Engine (TRIKE)**. It is a threat modeling framework focused on 📝simulating cyber threats and helping organizations identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in their systems and networks.  
- 🔴**Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST)**: a threat modeling concept that integrates threat and risk management into an 📝Agile programming environment on a scalable basis
- Part of the job of the security team is to identify threats, using different methods:
   - ✏️Focus on attackers: this is a useful method in specific situations;
    - e.g. suppose that a developer’s employment is terminated, and that post-offboarding and review of developer’s computer, a determination is made that the person was disgruntled and angry
      - understanding this situation as a possible threat, allows mitigation steps to be taken
   - ✏️Focus on assets: an org’s most valuable assets are likely to be targeted by attackers
   - ✏️Focus on software: orgs that develop applications in house, and can be viewed as part of the threat landscape; the goal isn’t to identify every possible attack, but to focus on the big picture, identifying risks and attack vectors
- Understanding threats to the org allow the documentation of potential attack vectors; diagramming can be used to list various technologies under threat
- 🔴**Reduction Analysis** (Also known as Decomposiing the application, system or environment): The purpose is to gain a greater understanding of the logic of a product, its internal components as well as its interactions and external elements:
- A reduction analysis supports threat modeling by identifying 📝elements common to underlying threats. If password attacks are a threat common to several applications but each of those applications relies on Microsoft Active Directory for authentication and authorization, then Microsoft Active Directory need only be evaluated once for password attacks (not for each application).
- The five key concepts of decomposition are
  - ✏️trust boundaries
  - ✏️dataflow paths
  - ✏️input points
  - ✏️privileged operations
  - ✏️Details about security stance and approach.
- 🔴**OCTAVE®**: OCTAVE® stands for Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluationsm, a risk management framework from Carnegie Mellon University. OCTAVE® describes a three-phase process for managing risk.
    - Phase 1 identifies staff knowledge, assets, and threats.
    - Phase 2 identifies vulnerabilities and evaluates safeguards.
    - Phase 3 conducts the risk analysis and develops the risk mitigation strategy.
[1.12](#1.12) Apply Supply Chain Risk Management (SRM) concepts (OSG-9 Chpt 1)
- 1.12.1 Risks associated with hardware, software, and services
  - ❄️**Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)**: the means to ensure that all of the vendors or links in the supply chain are: 
    - reliable, 
    - trustworthy, 
    - reputable organizations that disclose their practices and security requirements to their business partners (not necessarily to the public)
  - Each link in the chain should be responsible and accountable to the next link in the chain; each handoff is properly organized, documented, managed, and audited
  - Supply chain risk could be ✴️Hardware-focused, ✴️Software-focused, ✴️Services-focused.
    - The goal of a secure supply chain is that the finished product is of sufficient quality, meets performance and operational goals, provides stated security mechanisms, and that at no point in the process was any element counterfeited or subject to unauthorized or malicious manipulation or sabotage
  - The supply chain can be a threat vector, where materials, software, hardware, or data is being obtained from a supposedly trusted source but the supply chain behind the source could have been compromised and asset poisoned or modified
  - Void 📁**Authorization to operate (ATO)**: The situation of voiding the ATO of a vendor describes the fact that the vendor is not meeting minimal security requirements which are necessary to the protection of the service and its customers.
  - When dealing with suppliers, a Minimum security requirements should be modeled on your existing security policy. This is based on the idea that when working with a third party, that third party should have at least the same security as your organization.
  - The 📁**Silicon Root of Trust (SRoT)** refers to the security mechanisms embedded directly into the silicon of hardware components e.g IoT device, typically within a computer's processor or specialized security chip. Contains unique unchangable cryptographic key/identity (immutable fingerprint) established during manufaturing process that servers as a Trust Anchor. This embedded trust anchor is immutable and forms the foundation for all higher-level security functions and assurances within the system. If firmware is compromised, SRoT will changeand prevent system from booting because signature no longer matches.
      - 🔨an immutable system is a server or software product that, once configured and deployed, is never altered in place. 
  - A 📁**Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)** is a hardware-based security feature that generates a unique identifier or response based on the microscopic variations in the physical properties of an integrated circuit or chip. These variations arise naturally during the manufacturing process and are not replicable, making each PUF unique. When PUF is queried, it responds with a unique output based on this variations. This response is like a fingerprint that is impossible to clone or recreate in another device. Used in secure key generation, device authentication, anti-tampering and secure boot.
  - A 📁**Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** is a comprehensive list of all the components, libraries, modules, and dependencies included in a software application. It is akin to a list of ingredients in a recipe, detailing everything that goes into the software. SBOMs are crucial for understanding and managing the composition of software, ensuring transparency, security, and compliance. Attack in 2020 lead to US Govt requirement for SBOM in the 2021 Executive Order on Improving the Nations Cybersecurity.
  - 📁**Hardware Root of Trust (HRoT)**: A line of defense against executing unathorized firmware on a system. Establishes a chain of trust starting from hardware up through firmware and software layers (Trust Anchor). When certificates ares used for Full Disk Encryption (FDE), they use a hardware root of trust for key storage, which verifies the keys match before the secure boot process takes place. SRoT and PUF are also implemnetations of Hardware Root of trust. Componenets include
   - 🔥Trusted Platform Module (TPM): ✏️A hardware component that securely stores cryptographic keys and performs cryptographic operations. TPMs are built into many modern computers and can securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys, ensuring that private keys are kept safe from extraction or compromise. e.g bitlocker
   - 🔥Hardware Security Module (HSM): A dedicated hardware device designed to 🧠manage and protect digital keys and 🧠perform encryption and decryption.
   - 🔥Secure Enclave or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): An isolated area within the main processor that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of code and data loaded within it.

- 1.12.2 Third-party assessment and monitoring
  - Before doing business with another company, an org needs to perform due-dilligence, and third-party assessments can help gather information and perform the assessment
  - A third-party audit is performed by a third-party, such as defined by AICPA, to provide an unbiased review of an entity's security infrastructure. This audit may reveal where there are problems, but the audit should not be the basis of minimum security requirements for a third party selection.
    - 🔮on-site assessment is useful to gain information about physical security and operations. It is a third-party assessment tool where auditors visit the site of the organization to interview personnel and observe their operating habits.
    - 🔮Process/policy review is a mechanism that requests copies of their security policies, processes/procedures, and documentation of incidents and responses for review. Minimum security requirements should be modeled on your existing security policy. This is based on the idea that when working with a third party, that third party should have at least the same security as your organization.
    - 🔮Document exchange and review is a mechanism to investigate the means by which datasets and documentation are exchanged as well as the formal processes by which they perform assessments and reviews. During document review, your goal is to thoroughly review all the architecture, designs, implementations, policies, procedures, etc. 
    - A good understanding of the current state of the environment, especially to understand any shortcomings or compliance issues prior to integrating the IT infrastructures
    - The level of access and depth of information obtained is usually proportional to how closely the companies will work together
    - 📝Multiparty risk exists when several entities or organizations are involved in a project. The risk or threats are often due to the variations of objectives, expectations, timelines, budgets, and security priorities of those involved.
- 1.12.3 Minimum security requirements
  - As part of assessment, the minimum security requirements must be established; in some cases, the minimum security requirements are your company’s security requirements, in other cases, new minimum security requirements need to be established 
    - In such scenarios, the minimum security requirements should have a defined period
- 1.12.4 Service-level requirements
  - **🔥Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: companies have SLAs for internal operations (such as how long it takes for the helpdesk to respond to a new ticket), for customers (such as the availability of a public-facing service) and for partner orgs (such as how much support a vendor provides a partner) 
    - A service-level agreement may require you to meet the business continuity objectives of your customers.
    - All SLAs should be reviewed; a company sometimes has an SLA standard that should be applied, when possible, to the service level agreements as part of working with another company
      - this can sometimes take time, as the acquiring company might have to support established SLAs until they expire or are up for renewal
      - The primary place where the minimum-security requirements or SLR for a third-party should be documented is in the contract or service-level agreement (SLA) established with that vendor. A business partners agreement (BPA) and interconnection security agreement (ISA) are also useful options.
      - ❄️Business partners agreement (BPA) is a contract between two entities dictating the terms of their business relationship. It clearly defines the expectations and obligations of each partner in the endeavor. It focuses on the business partner relationship rather than that of a customer to a vendor.
      - ❄️interconnection security agreement (ISA): is a formal declaration of the security stance, risk, and technical requirements of a link between two organizations’ IT infrastructures) could also be viable answers. 
  - **🔥Service Level Requirements (SLRs)**: A service-level requirement (SLR) is a statement of the expectations of service and performance from the product or service of a vendor. Often, an SLR is provided by the ❄️customer/client prior to the establishment of the service-level agreement (SLA) (which should incorporate the elements of the SLR if the vendor expects the customer to sign the agreement).
  - **🔥Attestation**: information security attestation involves having a third-party organization review the practices of the service provider and make a statement about the security posture of the organization. The goal of the service provider is to provide evidence that they can and should be trusted. Typically, a third party provides attestation after performing an 📝audit of the service provider against a known baseline.
  -  **Vendor management system (VMS)**: VMS is a software solution that assists with the management and procurement of staffing services, hardware, software, and other needed products and services. A VMS can offer ordering convenience, order distribution, order training, consolidated billing, and more and they are a means to view, manage, or optimize the relationship between an organization and third-party suppliers. 
[1.13](#1.13) Establish and maintain a security awareness, education, and training program (OSG-9 Chpt 2)
- 1.13.1 Methods and techniques to present awareness and training (e.g., social engineering, phishing, security champions, gamification)
  - Before actual training takes place, user security awareness needs to take place; from there, training, or teaching employees to perform their work tasks and to comply with the security policy can begin
  - 📝Never assume that just because a worker was marked as attending or completing a training event that they actually learned anything or will be changing their behavior.
  - 📝Event and incident logs should be reviewed for the rate of occurrences of security violations due to employee actions and behaviors to see if there is any noticeable difference in the rate of occurrence or trends of incidents before and after a training presentation.
  - 📝Key Performance indicator (KPI): KPI can be used to measure performance (and success) of the awareness programe. 
  - ✴️**Training** is teaching employees to perform their work tasks and to comply with the security policy. Training is typically hosted by an organization and is targeted to groups of employees with 📝similar job functions. 
    - All new employees require some level of training so that they will be able to comply with all standards, guidelines, and procedures mandated by the security policy
    - Training should be mandatory and provided both to new employees and yearly (at a minimum) for ongoing training
    - Program effectiveness evaluation, such as giving a quiz or monitoring security incident rate changes over time, can be used to measure whether the training is beneficial or a waste of time and resources
    -  quiz or exam immediately after an awareness or training event and a follow-up quiz/exam months later
  - ✴️**Education** is a more detailed endeavor in which students/users learn much more than they actually need to know to perform their work tasks 
    - Education is most often associated with users pursuing certification or seeking job promotion
    -  Most education programs are not hosted by the employer but by training organizations or colleges or universities. Education is not provided to workers in groups based on their job positions.
  - ✴️**Awareness** establishes a common baseline or foundation of security understanding across the entire organization and focuses on key or basic topics and issues related to security that all employees must understand. Although it is provided by the organization, it is not targeted to groups of workers since it applies to all employees.
  - Employees need to understand what to be aware of (e.g. types of threats, such as phishing and free USB sticks), how to perform their jobs securely (e.g. encrypt sensitive data, physically protect valuable assets) and how security plays a role in the big picture (company reputation, profits,and losses) 
    - Routine tests of operational security should be performed (such as phishing test campaigns, tailgating at company doors and social engineering tests)
        - 🧨**Surveys**: It is the most 📝common. Most organizations use surveys to assess security awareness. Phishing simulators are also frequently used, but only test awareness of phishing issues and techniques, not general security awareness. Gamified applications are continuing to grow in popularity, but the ease of use and availability of surveys makes them the most popular. 
    - ✴️**Social engineering Campaign**: while many orgs don’t perform social engineering campaigns (testing employees using benign social engineering attempts) as part of security awareness, it is likely to gain traction. 
      - outside of campaigns, presenting social engineering scenarios and information is a common way to educate
    - ✴️**Phishing Campaign**: phishing campaigns are popular, and many orgs use third-party services to routinely test their employees with fake phishing emails. Phishing simulations are designed to bring interactivity to the effort and make it more interesting and engaging for users
      - such campaigns produce valuable data, such as the percentage of employees who open the phishing email, the percentage who open attachments or click links, and the percentage who report the fake phishing email as malicious
    - ✴️**Security champions**: the term “champion” has been gaining ground; orgs often use it to designate a person on a team who is a subject matter expert in a particular area or responsible for a specific area
      - e.g. somebody on the team could be a monitoring champion — they have deep knowledge around monitoring and evangelize the benefits of monitoring to the team or other teams
      - a security champion is a person responsible for evangelizing security, helping bring security to areas that require attention, and helping the team enhance their skills
      - Security champions are often
non-­security employees who take up the mantle to encourage others to support and adopt more security practices and behaviors.
    - ✴️**Gamification**: legacy training and education are typically based on reading and then answering multiple-choice questions to prove knowledge; gamification aims to make training and education more fun and engaging by packing educational material into a game. 📝Users generally find policy reviews and classroom training boring.
      - gamification has enabled organizations to get more out of the typical employee training
      - Gamification is a means to encourage compliance and engagement by integrating common elements of game play into other activities, such as security compliance and behavior change. This can include rewarding compliance behaviors and potentially punishing violating behaviors. Many aspects of game play can be integrated into security training and adoption, such as ✏️scoring points, ✏️earning achievements or badges (i.e., earn recognition), competing with others, ✏️cooperating with others (i.e., team up with coworkers), following a set of common/standard rules, having a defined goal, seeking rewards, developing group stories/experiences, and avoiding pitfalls or negative game events

- 📗**Social Engineering Attacks**: Note that some of these activities described is an opportunistic unauthorized access attack, which is not technically a social engineering attack since there was no interaction with the victim, just the opportunity when the victim walked away or is not paying attention.
     - 🔖**Phishing**: This involves sending fraudulent emails that appear to come from reputable sources. The goal is to trick recipients into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.
     - 🔖**Spear Phishing**: A more targeted form of phishing, spear phishing involves sending emails to specific individuals or organizations, often using personal information to make the attack more convincing.
     - 🔖**Whaling**: This type of phishing targets high-profile individuals like executives or important decision-makers within an organization. The emails are crafted to look like critical business communications.
     - 🔖**Vishing**: This is voice phishing, where attackers use phone calls to trick individuals into providing sensitive information. Often, attackers pose as legitimate entities like banks or government agencies.
     - 🔖**Smishing**: Similar to phishing but conducted via SMS (text messages), smishing involves sending texts that appear to come from trusted sources, prompting recipients to click on a link or provide personal information.
     - 🔖**Pretexting**: In this attack, the attacker creates a fabricated scenario (pretext) to obtain information or perform actions that benefit the attacker. This often involves impersonating someone in authority or a trusted individual.
     - 🔖**Baiting**: Baiting involves enticing a victim with something appealing (the "bait"), such as free software or music downloads, to trick them into providing personal information or downloading malware.
     - 🔖**Quid Pro Quo**: In this attack, the attacker offers a service or benefit in exchange for information. For example, an attacker might pose as an IT support person offering to help with a technical issue in exchange for login credentials.
     - 🔖**Tailgating (or Piggybacking)**: This involves an attacker gaining physical access to a restricted area by following closely behind an authorized person. The attacker relies on the person in front to hold the door open for them.
     - 🔖**Dumpster Diving**: This attack involves searching through an organization’s trash to find sensitive information that has not been properly disposed of. This could include discarded documents, hard drives, or other media.
     - 🔖**Impersonation**: Attackers pose as someone trustworthy, such as a co-worker, IT support, or a vendor, to gain the trust of the victim and extract information or gain access to systems.
     - 🔖**Shoulder Surfing**: This is the practice of spying on the user of an electronic device to obtain confidential information, such as passwords, PINs, or other sensitive data, by looking over their shoulder.
     - 🔖**Prepending**: Prepending refers to the technique of adding a term or phrase to the header of a communication to enhance its effectiveness as a social engineering attack. Prepending is commonly employed in phishing e-mails. Examples include spoofed subject tags such as "RE:" or "[INTERNAL]" to support pretexts, or spoofed header tags in the content body (e.g. "X-SPAM-STATUS: NO") to trick spam filters.

 - 📗**Social Engineering Principles:**
       - 📑**Familiarity Principle** Building rapport by creating a sense of familiarity or trust. social engineering pretext attack where the victim, is asked about a coworker (who doesn't actually exist). Familiarity or liking as a social engineering principle attempts to exploit a person's native trust in that which is familiar. This could include claiming to know a coworker even when that person doesn't exist. This is designed to put victim in a mindset that might be more willing to help the caller by providing answers to questions, since the person they asked to talk to is either not there or unknown
     - 📑**Authority Principle**: Exploiting the tendency for people to comply with individuals who appear to have legitimate authority. For example a  false invoice that was apparently received from the CEO makes it seem as if it originated from a proper authority. Business email compromise (BEC) is often performed by taking advantage of the social engineering principle of authority.
     - 📑**Scarcity Principle**: Using the principle of scarcity to make something seem rare or in limited supply, thus increasing its perceived value and encouraging the target to act quickly to secure it.
     - 📑**Urgency**: Creating a sense of urgency or pressure to force quick decisions. This often involves pretending there is an immediate problem or threat that requires prompt action, pushing the target to act without fully considering the consequences.
     - 📑**Reciprocity**: Leveraging the principle of reciprocity by offering something of value, even if it's just flattery or assistance, to create a sense of obligation. People may feel compelled to return the favor by providing information or access.
     - 📑**Consistency**: Exploiting the desire for individuals to remain consistent with their past actions or statements. For instance, if a target has previously provided information or agreed to a certain set of conditions, a social engineer might use that to persuade them to provide additional information or perform further actions, leveraging the target’s desire to appear consistent.
     - 📑**Social Proof**: Using the principle of social proof by suggesting that others have already taken the desired action or made similar decisions. This principle relies on the tendency of people to follow the behavior of others, especially in uncertain situations.
     - 📑**Trust**: Exploiting established trust or creating a sense of trustworthiness. Social engineers might impersonate someone who the target already knows and trusts, such as a colleague or a representative from a trusted organization.
     - 📑**Liking**: Leveraging the principle of liking by establishing a personal connection or finding common ground. People are more likely to comply with requests from individuals they find likable or relatable. Social engineers might use flattery, mimicry, or shared interests to build rapport and gain trust.
- 1.13.2 Periodic content reviews
  - Threats are complex, so training needs to be relevant and interesting to be effective; this means updating training materials and changing out the ways which security is tested and measured 
    - if you always use the same phishing test campaign or send it from the same account on the same day, it isn’t effective, and the same applies to other materials. 
    - instead of relying on long/detailed security documentation for training and awareness, consider using internal social media tools, videos and interactive campaigns
- 1.13.2 Program effectiveness evaluation 
  - Time and money must be allocated for evaluating the company’s security awareness and training; the company should track key metrics, such as the percentage of employees who click on a fake phishing campaign email links

- 🟦**TCB Common Criteria ISO/IEC 15408-1**: The International Common Criteria is an internationally agreed-upon standard for describing and testing the security of information technology (IT) products. The Common Criteria uses specific terms when defining specific portions of the testing process.
- ⭐Security Target: This defines the conditions of the test and is implementation-specific. It is a set of security requirements and specifications to be used as the basis for evaluation of an identified product/system. The documentation describing the ToE, including the security requirements and 
operational environment
- ⭐Target of Evaluation ToE: The system or product that is being evaluated i.e the actual product e.g Cisco ASA 5520 patch 2.7.2
- ⭐protection profile: which is an implementation-independent set of security requirements for a category of product/systems that meet specific consumer security needs. it includes category of product e.g Firewall.  An independent set of security requirements and objectives for a specific 
category of products or systems, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems
-  ⭐Evaluation assurance level (EAL): The evaluation score of the tested product or syste. The Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Levels 🟡"Ice Fishermen Sing Merry Melodies, So Stay Friendly!" are
    - EAL0 –Inadequate assurance
    - EAL1 –Functionally tested
    - EAL2 –Structurally tested
    - EAL3 –Methodically tested and checked
    - EAL4 –Methodically designed, tested and reviewed
    - EAL5 –Semi formally designed and tested
    - EAL6 –Semi formally verified design and tested
    - EAL7 –Formally verified design and tested

 - 🟦**System and Organization Controls (SOC)**: A security audit systematically evaluates an organization’s security policies,
standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with established security requirements.
- SOC 1: An audit and compliance report that focuses strictly on a company’s financial statements and controls that can impact a customer’s financial statements. A company that performs credit card processing is likely to require a SOC
1 audit and compliance report.
- SOC 2: An audit and compliance report that evaluates an organization based on AICPA’s five “Trust Services principles”: privacy, security, availability, processing integrity, and confidentiality. Many organizations undergo SOC 2 auditing and present a SOC 2 report to regulators and customers to demonstrate compliance with industry standard security controls.
- SOC 3: This is a “lite” version of a SOC 2 report and abstracts or removes all sensitive details. A SOC 3 report generally indicates whether an organization has demonstrated each of the five Trust Services principles without disclosing specifics (like exactly what they do or don’t do). Companies make SOC 3 reports available to the public and restrict SOC 2 reports to trusted parties.

- **QUANTITATIVE RISK MANAGEMENT**:
- 🔴**EF**: The exposure factor is the percentage of the facility that risk managers expect will be damaged if a risk materializes. It is calculated by dividing the amount of damage by the asset value. 
  - EF is the percentage of an asset's value that is expected to be lost if a specific threat event occurs.
  - Formula🔥: EF = (Loss due to the threat event ➗ Total asset value) ✖️ 100
  - Example: If a fire destroys 40% of a building's value, the EF is 40%.    
- 🔴**ARO**: The annualized rate of occurrence is the number of times that risk analysts expect a risk to happen in any given year. 
  - ARO is the expected frequency with which a specific threat will occur within a year.
  - ARO can be a whole number or a fraction, representing the number of occurrences per year.
  - Formula🔥: ARO = Number of occurence ➗ Number of Years
  - Example: 🔥If historical data suggests that a power outage happens twice a year, the ARO is 2. 🔥If a flood is expected to occur once every 10 years, the ARO is 0.1.
  - Example: 🔥The term 100-year flood plain is used to describe an area where flooding is expected once every 100 years. It is, however, more mathematically correct to say that this label indicates a 1 percent probability of flooding in any given year.
  - A 📝countermeasure primary affects the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO), because the countermeasure is designed to prevent (or mitigate or reduce) the occurrence of the risk, thus reducing its frequency per year. 
- 🔴**SLE**: The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the product of the asset value (AV) and the exposure factor (EF).
  - SLE is the monetary loss expected from a single occurrence of a threat event.
  - It is a measure of 💰risk impact.
  - Formula🔥: SLE = Asset Value (AV) ✖️ Exposure Factor (EF)
  - Example: If the asset value of a server is $10,000 and the EF for a fire is 40%, the SLE is $10,000 * 0.40 = $4,000.
- 🔴**ALE**: The annualized loss expectancy (ALE) represents the amount of money a business expects to lose to a given risk each year. ALE is the best metric to compare 📝relative risks because it incorporates both the likelihood and the impact of those risks. The annualized loss expectancy is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO).
  - it is measure of 💰relative risks
  - ALE is the expected monetary loss for an asset due to a specific threat over a one-year period.
  - Formula🔥: ALE = Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) ✖️ Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
  - Formula🔥: ALE = AV ✖️ EF ✖️ ARO
  - Example: If the SLE for a fire affecting a server is $4,000 and the ARO is 0.1, the ALE is $4,000 * 0.1 = $400.
- 🔴**Cost/Benefit Equation for Safeguards**: Anything that removes a vulnerability or protects against one or more specific threats is considered a safeguard or a countermeasure.
  -Formula🔥: ALE before safeguard – ALE after implementing the safeguard – annual cost of safeguard [(ALE1 – ALE2) – ACS]. 

- **Example Calculation**
  - Identify Asset Value (AV): Let's say the value of a database server is $50,000.
  - Determine the Exposure Factor (EF): A fire might destroy 30% of the server’s value. i.e EF = 30% = 0.30
  - Calculate the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE): SLE = AV * EF i.e SLE = $50,000 * 0.30 = $15,000
  - Estimate the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO): Based on historical data, a fire might occur once every 25 years. i.e ARO = 1/25 = 0.04
  - Calculate the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE): ALE = SLE * ARO, i.e ALE = $15,000 * 0.04 = $600

- 🍏**ISO 28000:2007,** “Specification for security management systems for the supply chain,” provides a broad framework for managing supply chain risk.
   - ISO 28000:2007 relies heavily on the continuous process improvement model of plan, do, check, act (PDCA or Deming cycle) to improve the security management system and to assure organizational conformance to the security practice.

- 🍏**ISO 17799 and the ISO 27000 Series**: ISO 17799 was a broad-based approach for the information security code of practice by the International Organization for Standardization, based in Geneva, Switzerland. The full title is ISO/IEC 17799:2005 Information technology—Security Techniques—Code of Practice for Information Security Management.
- ISO 17799:2005 signifies the 2005 version of the standard, based on BS (British Standard) 7799 Part 1. ISO 17799 had 11 areas, focusing on specific information security controls:
     - 1. Policy
       2. Organization of information security
       3. Asset management
       4. Human resources security
       5. Physical and environmental security
       6. Communications and operations management
       7. Access control
       8. Information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance
       9. Information security incident management
       10. Business continuity management
       11. Compliance
- ISO 17799 was renumbered to ISO 27002 in 2005 in order to make it consistent with the 27000 series of ISO security standards. ISO 27001 is a related standard, formally called ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Information technology—Security techniques—Information Security Management Systems—Requirements. ISO 27001 was based 
on BS 7799 Part 2
