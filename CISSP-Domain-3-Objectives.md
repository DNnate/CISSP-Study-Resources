[Domain 3](#domain3-top) **Security Architecture and Engineering**

You may find this domain to be more technical than others, and if you have experience woring in a security engineering role you likely have an advantage. If not, allocate extra time to this domain to ensure you have a good understanding of the topics
- **Algorithm**: a mathmatical function that is used in the encryption and decryption process; can be simply or very complex; also defined as a set of instructions by which encryption and decryption is done
- **Collision**: occurs when a hash function generates the same output for different inputs. Collision is a term related to hashing algorithms. If two pieces of plaintext hashes to the same value, there is a collision. This is the problem that the 📝birthday attack exploits.
- **Cryptanalysis**: study of techniques for attempting to defeat cryptographic techniques and generally information security services
    - **Frequency analysis**: form of cryptanalys that uses frequency of occurrence of letters, words or symbols in the plaintext as a way of reducing the search space
- **Cryptography**: study of/application of methods to ssecure the meaning and content of messages, files etc by disguise, obscuration, or other transformations.
    - 🔨**Encryption**: process and act of converting the message from plaintext to ciphertext (AKA enciphering)
        - 🎈**Block Mode Encryption**: using fixed-length sequences of input plaintext symbols as the unit of encryption
        - 🎈**Stream mode encryption**: system using a process that treats the input plaintext as a continuous flow of symbols, encrypting one symbol at a time; usually uses a streaming key, using part of the key as a one-time key for each symbol's encryption
    - 🔨**Decryption**: the reverse process from encryption
    - 🧨**Encoding**: action of changing a message or set of info into another format through the use of code; unlike encryption, encoded info can still be read by anyone with knowledge of the encoding process
    - 🧨**Decoding**: the reverse process from encoding, converting the encoded message back to plaintext format
    - Cryptography is used in
        - ⏰confidentiality in the form of encryption
        - ⏰integrity in the form of hashing
        - ⏰authentication in the form of asymmetric digital signatures and hashing.
- **Cryptosystem**: complete set of hardware, software, communictions elements and procedures that allow parties to communicate, store or use info protected by cryptographic means; includes algroithm, key, and key management functions
- **Cryptovariables(s)**: parameters associated with a particular cryptogrphic algorithm; e.g. block size, key length and number of iterations
- 🍮**An initialization vector (IV)** is a random bit string (a nonce) that is the same length as the block size that is XORed with the message. IVs are used to create a unique ciphertext every time the same message is encrypted with the same key.
    - An Initialization Vector (IV) is a random value used with a key to encrypt or decrypt data. The IV is used to reduce the likelihood of the same plaintext patterns being found in the ciphertext. One of the reasons Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was weak was because it used a short (24-bit) and predictable IV. This caused the same IV to be used multiple times throughout the stream, allowing attackers to find patterns between messages using the same IV.
    - The IV does not change the key length in any way. The purpose is to solely hide patterns found within the plaintext so that they are not exposed in the ciphertext. 
- **Key space**: represents the total number of possible values of keys in a cryptographic algorithm or password
- **Key Encryption Keys (KEK)** are encryption keys that are used to protect other keys. If there is an existing shared key it could be used to encrypt another key that makes it easier to exchange the original key.
- **Out-of-band**: transmitting or sharing control information (e.g. encryption keys and crypto variables) by means of a separate and distinct communications path, channel, or system
- 🍮**Transposition Cipher**: encryption/decription process using transposition. Transposition ciphers are a type of encryption method where the positions of the characters in the plaintext are shifted according to a certain system, effectively permuting the characters. Unlike substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers do not alter the actual characters themselves, only their 📝positions. e.g frequency of message might match known english language patterns. It can be broken with frequency analysis combined with pattern recognition.
    - Transposition is the process of altering the order of the plaintext in order to encrypt it. If the plaintext is again ‘when’ the ciphertext could be ‘hwne’. All of the letters are still there, they are just in a different order now. Today’s block cipher does a combination of both substitution and transposition. 
- 🍮**Substituion Cipher**: Encryption/decription process using subsitution. Substitution is the method of altering plaintext by replacing a value with a different value. i.e 📝characters are replaced. Examples include
     - 📁**Caesar Cipher**: A type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
     - 🎈ROT3: A specific case of the Caesar cipher where each letter is shifted by 3 places.
     - 🎈ROT13: A specific form of the Caesar cipher where each letter is shifted by 13 places.
     - 🎈AtBash: A substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet is mapped to its reverse.
     - 📁**Vigenere**: A polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters. The shifts are determined by the letters of the keyword. Vigenère ciphers are an example of a substitution cipher technique.
         - The Vigenère cipher was invented by Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century. It is a polyalphabetic cipher. Side note, it was first described by Bellaso in 1553.
         - Both Vernman and Vigenère are substitution ciphers.
     - 📁**Running Key Cipher**: A Running Key Cipher is a type of polyalphabetic substitution cipher where the key used for encryption is derived from a running or continuous text, usually a passage from a book or other lengthy text. It is a more secure version of the Vigenère cipher because it uses a much longer key, making it harder to detect patterns or repeat sequences in the ciphertext. It differes from one-time pad because the same key text can be reused and the key is not random. unlike one-time pad, the key is not exactly the same length as the plaintext.
     - 📁**One-­time Pad**: One-time pad is a series of randomly generated symmetric encryption keys, each one to be used only once by the sender and recipient. A one-time pad (OTP) is a theoretically unbreakable encryption technique in cryptography that involves using a random key that is as long as the message being sent. It is the only known cryptosystem that is not vulnerable to attacks. All other cryptosystems, including transposition ciphers, substitution ciphers, and even AES, are vulnerable to attack, even if no attack has yet been discovered. A one-­time pad is only appropriate for use in human-­to-­human communications.
        - 🎈The encryption key must be randomly generated (Keys must be genuinely random values)
        - 🎈The encryption key must be at least as long as the message to be encrypted. (The key must be the same length as the message)
        - 🎈Each one-time pad must be used only once (Keys can only be used one time)
        - 🎈The one-time pad must be physically protected against disclosure (The sender and receiver must keep the keys secure and Keys must be exchanged securely)
            - Gilbert Vernam invented the One-Time Pad (OTP) in 1917 and it is sometimes referred to as the 📝Vernam Cipher. A one-time pad requires a completely random key that is the same length as the message. Each bit of the message and the key are exclusive-OR (XOR) together. The resulting ciphertext is considered unbreakable by brute force as long as the key remains secure. For a one-time pad to be implemented correctly, keys cannot be reused and must truly be random.
        - Both Vernman and Vigenère are substitution ciphers. 
     - Substitution and transposition are two different types of encryption techniques. They are both used together in block ciphers today.
- 🍍**Work factor**: amount of effort necessary to break a cryptographic system, measured in elapsed time. When file encryption is strong, it is said to have increased the work factor level. Work factor refers to the difficulty of breaking an encrypted file. Therefore, it takes significantly more time to hack or break.
- 🍍**Confusion**: occurs when the relationship between the plaintext and the key is so complicated that an attacker can’t merely continue altering the plaintext and analyzing the resulting ciphertext to determine the key.
- 🍍**Diffusion** occurs when a change in the 📝plaintext results in multiple changes spread throughout the 📝ciphertext. Claude Shannon, at Belcore, wrote a paper in 1945 explaining that confusion and diffusion are two critical concepts in cryptography today. Diffusion speaks to the relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext. Basically, what is wanted is to ensure that patterns in the plaintext do not appear in the ciphertext. i.e 📝eliminate patterns
    - In cryptography, Diffusion is introduced using 📝Transposition. Diffusion means that if a single change in the plaintext occurs, multiple ciphertext changes will also occur. 
    - Diffusion occurs when there is enough change from plaintext to ciphertext. If one bit of the plaintext is changed there needs to be a significant change to the ciphertext. If not, there is too much predictability in the algorithm.
        - 🎈**Plaintext**: message or data in its readable form, not turned into a secret
        - 🎈**Cleartext**: any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding)
        - 🎈**Ciphertext**: altered form of a plaintext message so as to be unreadable for anyone expect the intended recipients (it's a secret)

[3.1](#3.1) Research, implement, and manage engineering processes using secure design principles (OSG-9 Chpts 1,8,9,16). The standard secure design principles are: ❄️threat modeling, ❄️least privilege, ❄️defense in depth, ❄️secure defaults, ❄️fail securely, ❄️separation of duties, ❄️keep it simple, ❄️zero trust, ❄️privacy by design, and ❄️trust but verify. 

- 3.1.1 Threat Modeling
    - ❄️**Threat modeling**: a security process where potential threats are identified, categorized, and analyzed. It can be performed as a
         - 🍉proactive measure during design and development
         - 🍉reactive measure once a product has been deployed
        - Threat modeling identifies the potential harm, the probability of occurrence, the priority of concern, and the means to eradicate or reduce the threat. The three common threat modeling approaches are
             - 🥩focus on attackers
             - 🥩focus on assets
             - 🥩focus on software. 
- 3.1.2 Least Privilege
    - ❄️**Least privilege**: states that subjects are granted only the privileges necessary to perform assigned work tasks and no more; this concept extends to data and systems
        - Limiting and controlling privileges based on this concept protects confidentiality and data integrity
        - Privilege creep indicates that an employee has accumulated permissions that they no longer require, indicating a violation of the least privilege principle.
- 3.1.3 Defense in Depth
    - ❄️**Defense in Depth**: AKA layering, is the use of multiple controls in a 📝series, where a single failed control should not result in exposure of systems or data. Layers should be used in a series (one after the other), 🚫NOT in parallel. When you see the terms levels, multilevel, layers, classifications, zones, realms, compartments, protection rings etc think about Defense in Depth
    - It is a security strategy that employs multiple layers of protection to safeguard an organization's assets. It involves implementing various security measures at different levels to provide overlapping layers of defense, thereby enhancing overall security. By implementing a variety of security controls across different layers (physical, technical, and administrative), organizations can better safeguard their resources against various threats.
    - The defense-in-depth principle suggests using multiple overlapping security controls to achieve the same control objective. E.g combined use of Network and host firewalls are both designed to limit network traffic and therefore are an example of defense in depth
- 3.1.4 Secure defaults
    - ❄️**Secure defaults**: when you think about defaults, consider how something operates brand new, just turned over to you by the vendor
        - e.g. wireless router default admin password, or firewall configuration requiring changes to meet an organization's needs
        -  The idea that systems should be designed to operate in a secure manner if the user performs no other configuration is the secure defaults principle
        -  The potential risks introduced by unconfigured settings are best addressed through the secure design principle of secure defaults. This principle demands product and solution teams consider the security implications of weak "default" settings in their product or solution (e.g. passwords, algorithms, or controls) and instead utilize responsible default security settings, even if those increase the complexity of implementation or use.
- 3.1.5 Fail securely
    - ❄️**Fail securely**: if a system, asset, or process fails, it shouldn't reveal sensitive information, or be less secure than during normal operation. Failing securely could involve reverting to defaults. The fail securely principle says that security controls should default to a secure state in the event of a control failure. 
- 3.1.6 Separation of duties (SoD)
    - ❄️**Separation of duties (SoD)**: separation of duties (SoD) and responsibilities ensures that no single person has total control over a critical function or system;  SoD is a process to minimize opportunities for misuse of data or environment damage 
        - e.g. one person sells tickets, another collects tickets and restricts access to ticket holders in a movie theater
        - hel[s to prevent 📝fraud
        - The separation of duties principle says that no employee should have permission to perform two tasks that, when combined, would pose a security risk
            - 🧰**Split knowledge** is a subset of the separation of duties. Split knowledge is the principle where the knowledge or "know-how" required to perform a privileged task is divided among multiple users. Hence, no single person has sufficient knowledge to compromise system security. 
    - ❄️**Two-Person Control**: where two people must concur to perform a sensitive action. E.g emergency access to system administrator privileges. Under this procedure, two qualified administrators must agree to retrieve emergency credentials. it requires two individuals to carry out critical tasks but does not explicitely prohibit individuals from knowing the entire process. It requires that both individuals are present at the same time in order to carry out that task. 
    - ❄️**M of N control** is a multi-person and split knowledge control that requires a 📝minimum number of individuals to provide credentials before action can occur. Credentials may be in the form of physical keys, digital keys, passwords, or biometric characteristics. M is the number required to be present and N is the total number possible. 
- 3.1.7 Keep it simple
    - ❄️**Keep it simple**: AKA keep it simple, stupid (KISS), this concept is the encouragement to avoid overcomplicating the environment, organization, or product design. The keep it simple principle says that security controls and other technologies should remain as simple as possible while still completing their objectives.
    3.1.8 Zero Trust
    - ❄️**Zero Trust**: Security architecture where no entity is trusted by default. Based on 3 principles
        - ⭐Assume Breach 
        - ⭐Verify Explicitly 
        - ⭐Least Privilege Access     
        - it is a security concept and alternative of the traditional (castle/moat) approach where nothing is automatically trusted; instead each request for activity or access is assumed to be from an unknown and untrusted location until otherwise verified
        - It suppports defense-in-depth which advises a layered approach to security
        - replaces trust but verify as a security design principle by asserting that all activities by all users/entities must be subject to control, authentication, authorization, and management at the most granular level possible (Trust but Verify invlolves a network perimeter beyond which everything is untrusted)
        - Zero trust addresses the limitations of the legacy network perimeter-based security model. It treats identity as the control plane and assumes compromise/breach when verifying every request.
        - Goal is to have every access request authenticated, authorized, and encrypted prior to access being granted to an asset or resource
        - The primary driver behind the adoption of the zero trust model has been the proliferation of endpoint devices. An endpoint device could be a user's workstation, a tablet, a smartphone, an IoT device, an ICS system, an edge computing sensor, and any public-facing servers in a screened subnet or extranet.
        - Being able to control, much less trust, all of these devices has caused the loss of a clearly defined security perimeter between the outside untrusted world and the inside trusted organization. This results in the "assume breach" stance, which requires organizations to "never trust, always verify."
        - In a zero trust network architecture,
             - 🍍The policy engine (PE) is responsible for making policy 📝decisions based upon rules and external data sources. It uses a trust algorithm to decide whether to grant, deny, or revoke access, considering factors like identity management, threat intelligence, and security information and event management (SIEM) data.
             - 🍍The policy administrator (PA), on the other hand, acts based on the decisions made by the policy engine, establishing or removing communication paths and managing session-specific credentials.
             - 🍍The policy enforcement point (PEP) enforces these decisions by controlling access to resources based on instructions from the policy administrator. Lastly, the subject refers to users, services, or systems that request access or attempt to use rights and is not involved in decision-making.
        - 🛑In a zero-trust network architecture, access control decisions should never be made based upon a system's location on the network. Therefore, an IP address should never be used and would be the least appropriate of these options. 
        - See my article on an [Overview of Zero Trust Basics](https://blog.balancedsec.com/p/an-overview-of-zero-trust-basics)
- 3.1.9 Privacy by design
    - ❄️**Privacy by design (PbD)**: a guideline to integrate privacy protections into products during the earliest design phase rather than tacking it on at the end of development
        - Same overall concept as "security by design" or "integrated security" where security is an element of design and architecture of a product starting at initiation and continuing through the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
        - There are 7 recognized principles to achieve privacy by design:
            - 1. 🚸Proactive, preventative; preventive, not remedial: think ahead and design for things that you anticipate might happen
              2. 🚸Privacy as the default setting: make private by default, e.g. social media app shouldn't share user data with everybody by default
              3. 🚸Privacy embedded into design: build privacy in; don’t add it later
              4. 🚸Full functionality—positive-sum, not zero-sum: achieve both security and privacy, not just one or the other
              5. 🚸End-to-end security—full lifecycle protection: privacy should be achieved before, during and after a transaction. Part of this is securely disposing of data when it is no longer needed
              6. 🚸Visibility and transparency—keep it open: publish the requirements and goals; audit them and publish the findings
              7. 🚸Respect for user privacy—keep it user-centric: involve end users, providing the right amount of information for them to make informed decisions about their data
- 3.1.10 Trust by verify
    - ❄️**Trust but verify**: based on a Russian proverb, and no longer sufficient; it's the traditional approach of trusting subjects and devices within a company's security perimeter automatically, leaving an org vulnerable to insider attacks and providing intruders the ability to easily perform lateral movement. The trust but verify principle says that organizations should use auditing to ensure that control objectives are met.
        - Trust but verify is a secure design principle that challenges assumptions of trust derived from certain criteria without trust being explicitly verified (e.g. traffic originating from an internal network) 
- 3.1.11 Shared responsibility 
    - 🟣**Shared responsibility**: the security design principle that indicates that organizations do not operate in isolation
        - ⭐Everyone in an organization has some level of security responsibility
        - ⭐the job of the CISO and security team is to establish & maintain security
        - ⭐The job of regular employees to perform their tasks within the confines of security
        - ⭐The job of the auditor is to monitor the environment for violations
        - ⭐When working with third parties, especially with cloud providers, each entity needs to understand their portion of the shared responsibility of performing work operations and maintaining security. This is often referenced as the **cloud shared responsibility model**
        - ⭐Organizations are responsible to their stakeholders for making good security decisions in order to sustain the organization.
        - ⭐As we become aware of new vulnerabilities and threats, we should consider it our responsibility (if not our duty) to responsibly disclose that information to the proper vendor or to an information sharing center.

- 3.1.12 Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)
    - 🟣**SASE**: A design philosophy closely related to Zero trust Network Architecture. 🔥Brings together networking and security functions and delivers them as an integrated cloud service.
    - Described as Gartner in 2019 as a networking model that merges traditional WAN managment and security capabilites into a unified whole
    - It is built, implemented and managed  using 🔥cloud-native architectures. It is a responde to the the edge-centric trends in mobility, cloud, SD-WAN and the internet of things. It is WAN implmentation in the world of hybrid and public cloud. SASE compnents include:
     - ⭐Firewall services
     - ⭐secure web gateway
     - ⭐anti-malware services
     - ⭐intrusion prevention services
     - ⭐cloud access service broker (CASB)
     - ⭐Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 

[3.2](#3.2) Understand the fundamental concepts of security modles (e.g. Biba, Star Model, Bell-LaPadula) (OSG-9 Chpt 8)
- Security models:
    - Intended to provide an explicit set of rules that a computer can follow to implement the fundamental security concepts, processes, and procedures of a security policy 
    - Provide a way for a designer to map abstract statements into a security policy prescribing the algorithms and data structures necessary to build hardware and software
    - Enable people to access only the data classified for their clearance level
    - A security model provides a framework to implement a security policy.
    - ⚓**The State Machine Model** describes a system that is always secure no matter what state it is in. A 📝secure state machine model system always boots into a secure state, maintains a secure state across all transitions, and allows subjects to access resources only in a secure manner compliant with the security policy. Bell–LaPadula and Biba are built on a state machine model.  State machine is a term used to define the condition a system is in. If the state meets the security requirements, it can be considered a secure state. States can then transition to other states, this is called state transition. 
        - 📝State transition is the terminology used for activities that can alter a machine's state. State machine security models require that all actions that change the state must be authorized, and the machine's state must remain secure during transitions. 
    - ⚓**Information-flow Model** prevents the 📝movement of information from one classification to another. Bell LaPadula and Biba are both information-flow models. The model controls the flow of information from high-security to low-security classifications. These models are used to avoid unauthorized access to data or compromises to data integrity.
         - The information flow model applies state machines to the flow of information.
         - The Bell-LaPadula model applies the information flow model to confidentiality while the Biba model applies it to integrity. They both use security labels on objects and clearances for subjects and is therefore a MAC model. They are both multilevel models.
     - ⚓**Noninterference Model** is the concept of limiting the 📝actions of a subject at a higher security level so that they do not affect the system state or the actions of a subject at a lower security level. It is based on 📝rules to prevent 📝processes operating in different domains from affecting each other in violation of security policy. The 📝Goguen-Meseguer Model layed the foundation for this model.
    - ⚓**Multilevel Security (MLS) Model** The concept of MLS is the idea that a system would have multiple levels of classification in the same system. Bell-LaPadula was the first mathematical model of a Multilevel Security (MLS) policy. Access control philosophies can be organized into models that define approaches to security issues. The Take-Grant model, the Bell-LaPadula model, and the Biba model are examples of different access control models.

- 🔴**Bell-LaPadula**: Model was established in 1973. The goal is to ensure that information is exposed only to those with the right level of classification. Bell-LaPadula was released in 1976 by the US government to provide for better confidentiality
    - Focuse is on confidentiality📝
    - Simple security property: 🔥No read-up 
    - Star (*) security property: 🔥No write-down ( an individual may not write to a file at a lower classification level than that of the individual. AKA confinement property)
    - Discretionary Security Property: uses an access matrix (need to know in order to access)
    - Doesn't address covert channels
- 🔴**Biba**: Released in 1977, this model was created to supplement Bell-LaPadula 
    - Focus is on integrity📝
    -  is based on information flow, and is a multilevel model.
    - Simple integrity property: 🔥No read down ( individual may not read a file classified at a lower security level than the individual's security clearance. for example, users with a Top Secret clearance can’t read data classified as Secret). the implied allowed opposite is read-up.
    - Star (*) integrity property: 🔥No write up (for example, a user with a Secret clearance can’t write data to files classified as Top Secret)
    - By combining it with Bell-LaPadula, you get both confidentiality and integrity
- 🔴**Take-Grant**: 
    - The take-grant model employs a directed graph to dictate how rights can be passed from one subject to another, or from a subject to an object
    - Four rules: 
        - ⚒️take: The right to remove or take permissions from other users. The take rule allows a subject to take the rights belonging to another object. 
        - ⚒️grant: The grant rule allows a subject to grant rights that it possesses on an object to another subject.
        - ⚒️create: The create rule allows a subject to create new objects and also creates an edge from the subject to that object, granting rights on the new object.
        - ⚒️remove
- 🔴**Clark-Wilson**: The Clark–Wilson model uses a multifaceted approach to enforcing data integrity. Instead of defining a formal state machine, the Clark–Wilson model defines each data item and allowable data transformations. The Clark-Wilson model focuses on data integrity and it relies on the separation of duties. Subjects access and modify objects 📝indirectly through an interface or program. This is known as the 📝"access triple" and is made up of the subject/program/object. The Clark-Wilson model defines Constrained Data Items (CDI) and integrity verification procedures and confirms transformation procedures.
    - Focus is on 📝integrity. Clark and Wilson defined the following as the three goals of integrity in their security model that was published in 1987.
        - ⚒️Rule 1: Prevent unauthorized users from making any modifications.
        - ⚒️Rule 2: Prevent authorized users from making improper modifications.
        - ⚒️Rule 3: Maintain internal and external consistency.
    - Designed to protect integrity using the access control 📝triplet (‼️Subject, ‼️Object, ‼️Program/Interface)
        - 🎈Object: an object is a 📝passive entity that an active subject accesses. Examples include databases, computers, programs, processes, scripts, and storage media. An object is not automated and has to be manipulated by a subject.
        - 🎈Subject: The subject is the 📝active entity as it takes action on the object. The active entity could be a user, a process, a program, a script, etc. Anything that takes action on something else in the computer.      
    - The Clark–Wilson model defines the constrained data item, transformation procedures, and integrity verification procedure.
    - A program interface is used to limit what is done by a subject; if the focus of an intermediary program between subject and object is to protect integrity, then it is an implementation of the Clark-Wilson model.
        - 📝Constrained Data Items (CDI) are the pieces of data that the integrity policies are applied to.
        - 📝Transformation Procedures (TP) apply to the concept of a Well Formed Transaction (WFT). The TP ensures that the CDI is transformed (changed) from one valid state to another.
        - 📝Well Formed Transaction (WFT) has three fundamental ideas.
            - 🩹A transaction is well-formed if it has not been tampered with
            - 🩹A transaction is well-formed if it has been logged
            - 🩹A transaction is well-formed if the values maintain consistency. 
- 🔴**Brewer and Nash Model**:
    - AKA "ethical wall", and "cone of silence"
    - created to permit access controls to change dynamically based on a user's previous activity
    - dynamically changes access controls to prevents 📝conflicts of interest.
    - implemented in environments where data from different clients exist
    -  - Focus is on Confidentiality📝
- 🔴**Goguen-Meseguer Model**:
    - An integrity model📝
    - it is based on 📝predetermining the set or domain (i.e., a list) of objects that a subject can access.
    - Foundation of noninterference conceptual theories
- 🔴**Sutherland Model**:
    - Focuses on preventing 📝interference in support of integrity
    - Focus is on Integrity📝 and Confidentiality📝
- 🔴**Graham-Denning Model**
    - Focused on the secure 📝creation and 📝deletion of both subjects and objects
    - 8 primary protection rules or actions
        - ✏️1-4:securely create/delete a subject/object
        - ✏️5-8:securely provide the read/grant/delete/transfer access right
- 🔴**Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman Model**:
    - Focuses on the assignment of object access rights to subjects as well as the integrity/resilience of those assigned rights
    - HRU is an 🔥extension of Graham-Denning model
- 🔴**Star Model**: 
    - Not an official model, but name refers to using asterisks (stars) to dictate whether a person at a specific level of confidentiality is allowed to write data to a lower level of confidentiality
    - Also determines whether a person can read or write to a higher or lower level of confidentiality
    - 📝Strong star (*) property states that a subject may not read or write information that resides at any security level, except for the level the subject is a member of.
- 🔴**Access Control Matrix**: 
    - An access control matrix assembles ACLs from multiple objects into a single table.
         - Access control list is a list of individual users who may access the file.  An ACL is a list of permissions attached to an object (such as a file, directory, or network resource) that specifies which users or systems are granted access and what kind of access they are permitted. Access Control List  consists of multiple access control entries.
         - Access Control Entry: An ACE is a single entry within an ACL that defines the access rights for a specific user or group on a particular resource. Each ACE in an ACL specifies the permissions granted to a single user or group. It essentially defines a rule for access control in the context of the larger ACL.
     - 📝ACL: Refers to the entire list of access control rules for a particular resource. 📝ACE: Refers to a single entry within that list, specifying permissions for one user or group.
    - The rows of that table are the ACEs of a subject across those objects, thus a capabilities list.
- 🔴**Capability Tables**: 
    - They are different from ACLs in that a capability table is focused on subjects (such as users, groups, or roles).
    - For example, a capability table created for the accounting role will include a list of all objects that the accounting role can access as well as the specific privileges assigned to the accounting role for these objects. In contrast, ACLs are focused on objects.

[3.3](#3.3) Select controls based upon systems security requirements (OSG-9 Chpt 8)

- 📗**Common Criteria (CC)** for Information Technology Security Evaluation.
- The U.S. Department of Defense-developed Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), and the European Union-developed Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) were both replaced with Common Criteria. Common Criteria is published as International Standards Organization (ISO) Standard 15408. It was developed as a standard for 📝evaluating information technology products. Arguably, ISO 15408 is the international standard for system security evaluation criteria, but that is not the real name. 
- Common Criteria is the name used for the International Standards Organization (ISO) 15408 standard. ISO 15408 is a testing criterion for security products. It is designed as an independent, third-party testing mechanism. It is also good for software developers to use, especially if they want to achieve a higher score when tested against Common Criteria.
    - The CC provides a standard to evaluate systems, defining various levels of testing and confirmation of systems' security capabilities
    - The primary distinction of the current Common Criteria (CC) from the previous security evaluation criteria systems it replaced is that the CC is a dynamic and subjective evaluation of security mechanisms and functions via the protection profiles (PPs) and security targets (STs) comparison mechanism. Most previous systems were static in their evaluation of security protection mechanisms.
    - The number of the level indicates what kind of testing and confirmation has been performed
- The important concepts:
    - ✴️**Target of Evaluation (TOE)** To perform an evaluation, you need to select the TOE (e.g. firewall or an anti-malware app)
    - ✴️**Protection Profile (PP)** The evaluation process will look at the PP, which is a document that outlines the security needs (customer 🔥"I wants"🔥); a vendor might use a specific protection profile for a particular solution
    - ✴️**Security Target (ST)** The evaluation process will look at the ST, specifying the claims of security from the vendor that are built into a TOE (the ST is usually published to customers and partners and available to internal staff). STs are considered the implemented security measures or the 🔥"I will provide"🔥 from the vendor.
    - An organization's PP is compared to various STs from the selected vendor's TOEs, and the closest or best match is what the org purchases
    - The evaluation will attempt to gauge the confidence level of a security feature 
    - 💥**Security assurance requirements (SARs)**: Assurance is the degree of confidence that an organization has that its security controls are correctly implemented. It must be continually monitored and reverified. SAR is a description of how the TOE is to be evaluated, based on the development of the solution
    - Key actions during development and testing should be captured 
    - 💥**Evaluation assurance level (EAL)**: a numerical rating used to assess the rigor of an evaluation; the scale is EAL 1 (cheap and easy) to EAL7 (expensive and complex): 🟡FSMMSSF (Fishermen sing merry melodies so stay friendly)
        - 🍐EAL1: functionally tested (lowest level of assurance)
        - 🍐EAL2: structurally tested
        - 🍐EAL3: methodically tested and checked
        - 🍐EAL4: methodically designed, tested, and reviewed
        - 🍐EAL5: semi-formally designed and tested
        - 🍐EAL6: semi-formally verified, designed, and tested
        - 🍐EAL7: formally verified, designed, and tested
- **Authorization to Operate (ATO)**: official auth to use specific IT systems to perform tasks/accept identified risks: The four types of ATOs are
    - 🍊Authorization to Operate
    - 🍊Common Control Authorization
    - 🍊Authorization to Use
    - 🍊Denial of Authorization.
- **System Assurance Processes:**
  - 🍌Certification: Evaluating a system to ensure it meets specified security requirements.
  - 🍌Verification: The verification process is similar to the certification process in that it validates security controls. Verification may go a step further by involving a 📝third-party testing service and compiling results that may be trusted by many different organizations.
  - 🍌Accreditation: Officially authorizing the system to operate based on its security certification. It is the act of management formally accepting an evaluating system, not evaluating the system itself. 
[3.4](#3.4) Understand security capabilities of Information Systems (IS) (e.g. memory protection, Trusted Platform Model (TPM), encryption/decryption) (OSG-9 Chpt 8)
- 🍎**Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)**, also known as the Orange Book. These modes are used to categorize the security features of a computer system based on its ability to enforce confidentiality and access control policies.
    - ✴️**Dedicated Mode**: In Dedicated mode, the system is used for information of a single classification level, and all users must have at least the clearance level necessary to access that information.
    - ✴️**Controlled Access Mode**: In Controlled Access mode, the system enforces access controls based on user identity and clearance levels but does not require that all users have the highest clearance level.
    - ✴️**Multilevel/Multistate Mode**: In Multilevel mode, the system can handle information at multiple classification levels simultaneously. Users can access information according to their clearance and need-to-know basis, and the system dynamically enforces access controls based on the classification of the data. 📝Multistate systems are certified to handle data from different security classifications simultaneously by implementing protection mechanisms that segregate data appropriately.
    - ✴️**System High mode**: : In System High mode, the system enforces access control based on the classification level of the information, and all users must have a security clearance that is at least equal to the highest classification level of the information they can access. For systems running in System High mode, the user must have a valid security clearance for all information processed by the system, access approval for all information processed by the system, and a valid need to know for some, but not necessarily all, information processed by the system.

- Security capabilities of information systems include memory protection, virtualization, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), encryption/decryption, interfaces, and fault tolerance
- 🟣**Memory Protection:** A computing device is likely running multiple apps and services simultaneously, each occupying a segment of memory; the goal of memory protection is to prevent one app or service from impacting another
    - Memory protection is a mechanism used in computer systems to prevent processes or programs from accessing memory regions that they are not authorized to access. This includes protecting the operating system kernel and other critical system data from unauthorized modifications by user-level processes. Memory protection is typically implemented through hardware and software mechanisms such as memory segmentation, paging, access control lists, and memory protection keys. It helps enhance system stability, security, and reliability by isolating processes and preventing unintended interference or corruption of memory contents. 
        - 🎈Virtual is a technique of managing memory that allows secondary memory to be used as if it were primary memory. 📝Paging is a method to utilize the virtual memory in a pagefile or swapfile, not a valid operating system process state.
        - 🎈Cache memory is a high-speed, small-capacity storage unit located 📝between a computer's 📝main memory (RAM) and the 📝CPU. It stores 📝frequently used data and instructions, reducing the time needed to access them, thereby boosting overall system performance.
        - 🎈Logical memory is used by 📝applications as only CPU can access memory directly. The logical address is used by applications to assign and allocate memory. The logical address is mapped to a physical memory location by the 📝memory mapper. 
- Memory protection is a core security component that must be designed and implemented into an operating system. It must be enforced regardless of the programs executing in the system. Otherwise, instability, violation of integrity, denial of service, and disclosure are likely results.
- There are two primary memory protection methods:
    - 🐊**Process isolation**: OS provides separate memory spaces for each processes instructions and data, and prevents one process from impacting another. Isolating threads would be a function of the operating system. It is the practice of isolating threads or execution units within a process to prevent them from interfering with each other's data or state. Isolation can be achieved through various mechanisms including 📝locks, 📝semaphores, and memory barriers. This is crucial to maintain the stability and correctness of concurrent software, as it prevents issues like data races and ensures the predictable behavior of threads within a program.
    - 🐊**Hardware segmentation**: forces separation via physical hardware controls rather than logical processes; in this type of segmentation, the operating system maps processes to dedicated memory locations.
        - To ensure low-privilege processes cannot access and modify a high-level process’s memory space, Higher trust levels often require hardware segmentation of memory.
        - This memory becomes physically separated, not just logically separated. The physical security controls add a protection level from outside processes accessing memory resources for a particular application.
    - Memory Management:
        - 🏓Concurrent memory management involves managing memory resources in a computing system while multiple processes or threads are concurrently accessing and modifying memory. This includes allocating and deallocating memory, handling memory fragmentation, and ensuring memory consistency and synchronization to prevent data corruption and maintain system stability during concurrent operations.
        - 🏓Secured memory management involves implementing measures to protect sensitive data stored in memory from unauthorized access, tampering, or leakage. This includes encrypting data in memory, implementing access controls and permissions, ensuring secure memory allocation and deallocation processes, and employing techniques such as memory isolation and secure enclaves.
- 🟣**Confinement/Constrained Process**: A constrained process is one that can access only certain memory locations. Using a sandbox is an example of confinement, where the system restricts the access of a particular process to limit its ability to affect other processes running on the same system.
    - A sandbox is designed to limit access to certain system areas. A sandbox is used in development to separate development code from other production environments. It's also used to contain malware or malicious code to review the code's activity but protect the operating system, network, and other software from being affected by the malware code. 
- 🟣**Virtualization**: technology used to host one or more operating systems within the memory of a single host, or to run applications that are not compatible with the host OS; the goal is to protect the hypervisor and ensure that compromising one VM doesn't affect others on that host
- 🟣**Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: a cryptographic chip that is sometimes included with a client computer or server; a TPM enhances the capabilities of a computer by offering hardware-based cryptographic operations
    - 🔥TPM is a tamper-resistant integrated circuit built into some motherboards that can perform cryptographic operations (including key gen) and protect small amoutns of sensitive info, like passwords and cryptographic keys
    - The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware security technique that stores an encryption key on a chip on the motherboard and prevents someone from accessing an encrypted drive by installing it in another computer.
    - Many security products and encryption solutions require a TPM
    - TPM is both a specification for a cryptoprocessor chip on a motherboard and the general name for implementation of the specification
    - TPM is a motherboard component designed to support the security of hardware through integrated cryptographic keys. It frequently interoperates with the operating system to validate trusted users and deliver extended security capabilities (e.g. full disk encryption).
    - Remote attestation creates a hash value from the system configuration to confirm the integrity of the configuration.
    - 📝Binding and 📝sealing are techniques used by the TPM to encrypt data.
    - The random number generator (RNG) function of the TPM is used to support cryptographic operations.
    - TPM does include  Storage Root Key (SRK), which is used for managing and protecting cryptographic operations and keys within the TPM.
    - in a TPM iplementation, the files on the drive are at their most secure when the system is off and the drive is encrypted and not in a readable state. BitLocker decrypts files as needed when in use, meaning that any time after the system is booted files may be accessed, particularly if the user is logged in and access to the system can be gained or if malware is running.
    - A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a 📝physical microcontroller used to store and release decryption keys securely. TPMs are frequently utilized for full-disk encryption to ensure data at rest is encrypted. Microsoft’s BitLocker leverages a TPM chip to encrypt data written to the disk.
    - A TPM is an example of a hardware security module (HSM)
         - 🚡**Hardware Security Module (HSM)**: a cryptoprocessor used to manage and store digital encryption keys, accelerate crypto operations, support faster digital signatures, and improve authentication. HSMs include root keys and are used for high-security key management.
         - They are generally used in 📝server environments rather than directly on endpoints.
         - Hardware Security Modules (HSM) are designed to store keys, but they are 🚫not within a computer.
         - They are usually 📝rack-mountable devices.
         - They support servers rather than being hardware installed within a computer on the motherboard.
         - Hardware Security Modules, or HSMs, are the most secure way to store keys associated with a CMS. They provide enhanced key management capabilities and are often required to be FIPS certified. In addition to these advantages, an HSM can improve cryptographic performance for the organization due to dedicated hardware designed for just that purpose. 
- 🟣**User interface**: a constrained UI can be used in an application to restrict what users can do or see based on their privileges
    - e.g. dimming/graying out capabilities for users without the correct privilege
    - A constrained or restricted interface is implemented within an application to restrict what users can do or see based on their privileges. The purpose of a constrained interface is to limit or restrict the actions of both authorized and unauthorized users.
    - An interface is also the method by which two or more systems communicate
    - A constrained interface or restricted interface can be used to protect integrity (such as the focus of the Clark–Wilson model) or confidentiality.
- Be aware of the common security capabilities of interfaces:
    - **Encryption/decryption**: when communications are encrypted, a client and server can communicate without exposing information to the network; when an interface doesn’t provide such a capability, use IPsec or another encrypted transport mechanism
         - 📁**Internet protocol security (IPsec)** is a suite of protocols that provides protection at the network layer of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. IPsec is frequently used to establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between two routers. IPsec protects the original IP packet by encrypting or hashing the IP packet and adding a new AH or ESP header with a new IP header. IPsec-specific protocols are ESP and AH: In the context of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) and AH (Authentication Header) are two different protocols used in IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) to secure network communications.
              -  **🎬ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)**: The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol provides confidentiality and integrity for packet contents. It encrypts packet payloads and provides limited authentication and protection against replay attacks. ESP provides confidentiality by encrypting the data being transmitted. ESP can also provide optional authentication, which verifies the integrity of the data and ensures that it has not been tampered with. 📝Padding in ESP can serve multiple purposes, including aligning the payload to the required block size for encryption and hiding the true length of the payload. By adding additional padding, ESP can obscure the actual size of the data being transmitted, which helps in providing partial traffic flow confidentiality. This makes it harder for an attacker to infer details about the communication based on the length of packets.📝Protection against replay attack is handled by the use of sequence numbers in ESP
              -  **🎬AH (Authentication Header)**: AH provides data integrity and authentication by adding a header to the IP packet. This header contains a cryptographic checksum (or hash) that ensures the data has not been altered in transit and verifies the identity of the sender. Unlike ESP, AH does not provide encryption, so the data itself remains visible to anyone who intercepts it. It only ensures that the data has not been modified and that it comes from a legitimate source. AH is less commonly used on its own in VPNs because it does not offer encryption. It’s often used in conjunction with ESP to provide a more comprehensive security solution.
    - **Signing**: used for 🔥non-repudiation; in a high-security environment, both encrypt and sign all communications if possible
- 🟣**Fault tolerance**: capability used to enhance availability; in the event of an attack (e.g. DoS), or system failure, fault tolerance helps keep a system up and running

[3.5](#3.5) Assess and mitigate the vulnerabilities of security architectures, designs and solution elements (OSG-9 Chpts 9,16,20)

This objective relates to identifying vulnerabilities and corresponding mitigating contols and solutions; the key is understanding the types of vulnerabilities commonly present in different environments, and their mitigation options
- 3.5.1 Client-based systems
    - **Client-based systems**: client computers are the most attacked entry point
    - Compromised client computers can be used to launch other attacks
    - Productivity software and browsers are constant targets
    - Even patched client computers are at risk due to phishing and social engineering vectors
    - Mitigation: run a full suite of security software, including anti-virus/malware, anti-spyware, and host-based firewall
- 3.5.2 Server-based systems
    - **Data Flow Control**: movement of data between processes, between devices, across a network, or over a communications channel
    - Management of data flow seeks to minimize latency/delays, keep traffic confidential (i.e. using encryption), not overload traffic (i.e. load balancer), and can be provided by network devices/applications and services
    - While attackers may initially target client computers, servers are often the goal
    - **Mitigation**: regular patching, deploying hardened server OS images for builds, and use host-based firewalls

- 3.5.3 Database systems
    - Databases often store a company's most sensitive data (e.g. proprietary, CC info, PHI, and PII)
    - Attackers may use inference or aggregation to obtain confidential information
    - ✴️**Aggregation attack**: process where SQL provides a number of functions that combine records from one or more tables to produce potentially useful info. In an aggregation attack, individual(s) use their access to specific pieces of information to piece together a larger picture that they are not authorized to access.
    - ✴️**Inference attack**: involves combining several pieces of nonsensitive info to gain access to that which should be classified at a higher level; inference makes use of the human mind’s deductive capacity rather than the raw mathematical ability of database platforms

- 3.5.4 Cryptographic systems
    - Goal of a well-implemented cryptographic system is to make compromise too time-consuming and/or expensive 
    - Each component has vulnerabilities:
        - 🍎**Kerckhoff's Principle** (AKA Kerckhoff's assumption): a cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. The principle can be summed up as “The enemy knows the system.”
        - Software: used to encrypt/decrypt data; can be a standalone app, command-line, built into the OS or called via API; like any software, there are likely bugs/issues, so regular patching is important
        - Keys: dictate how encryption is applied through an algorithm; a key should remain secret, otherwise the security of the encrypted data is at risk  
            - **key space**: represents all possible permutations of a key
            - key space best practices: 
                - key length is an important consideration; use as long of a key as possible (your goal is to outpace projected increase in cryptanalytic capability during the time the data must be kept safe); longer keys discourage brute-force attacks
                    - Binary keyspaces contain a number of keys equal to 2 raised to the power of the number of bits. For example, incresing key space by 8 bits, two to the eighth power is 256, so the keyspace will increase by a factor of 256.
                    - a 256-bit key is typically minimum recommendation for symmetric encryption
                    - 2048-bit key typically the minimum for asymmetric
                - always store secret keys securely, and if you must transmit them over a network, do so in a manner that protects them from unauthorized disclosure 
                - select the key using an approach that has as much randomness as possible, taking advantage of the entire key space 
                - destroy keys securely, when no longer needed
            - always base key length on requirements and sensitivity of the data being handled
        - Algorithms: choose algorithms (or ciphers) with a large key space and a large random **key value** (key value is used by an algorithm for the encryption process) 
            - algorithms themselves are not secret; they have extensive public details about history and how they function

- 3.5.5 Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
    - ❄️**Industrial control systems (ICS)**: a form of computer-management device that controls industrial processes and machines, also known as operational technology (OT): ICS examples include distributed control systems (DCSs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA).
    - **Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)**: systems used to control physical devices like those in an electrical power plant or factory; SCADA systems are well suited for distributed environments, such as those spanning continents 
        - SCADA systems are large Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) that can span large 📝geographic areas. SCADA systems control and supervise operations using inputs from Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors, and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI). The supervisory computers of the SCADA system use this input to send commands to Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) to alter a process or generate alarms.
            - 📝A Programmable Logic Controllers  (PLC) is a controller that can have multiple inputs and outputs. PLCs are often networked and controlled by a supervisory computer. A 📝Distributed Control System (DCS) is a network of PLCs, sensors, and supervisory computers. Generally, a DCS is process-specific and does not span large geographical areas, whereas a SCADA system controls multiple processes and can span large geographical areas. 
        - some SCADA systems still rely on legacy or proprietary communications, putting them at risk, especially as attackers gain knowledge of such systems and their vulnerabilities
        - In industrial control systems (ICSs), ensuring the availability of ♨️real-time control signals is a primary concern. The immediate and continuous availability of control signals is critical for the proper functioning of industrial processes.
        - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, or SCADA systems, provide a graphical interface to monitor industrial control systems (ICS). 
        - SCADA risk mitigations:
            - ✏️isolate networks 
            - ✏️limit access physically and logically 
            - ✏️restrict code to only essential apps 
            - ✏️log all activity
- 3.5.6 Cloud-based systems (e.g., Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS))
    - **Cloud-based systems**: on-demand access to computing resources available from almost anywhere
        - 🍎Public Cloud: Operates a multitenant environments, where the services are delivered over the public Internet and shared across different organizations. In the public cloud computing model, the vendor builds a single platform that is shared among many different customers. This is also known as the shared tenancy model.
        - 🍎Private/Dedicated cloud: also known as a private cloud, is infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally.
        - 🍎Hybrid cloud: is a composition of two or more cloud delivery models (private, community, or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.
    - Cloud's primary challenge:
        - resources are outside the org’s direct control, making it more difficult to manage risk
        - Orgs should formally define requirements to store and process data stored in the cloud
        - Focus your efforts on areas that you can control, such as the network entry and exit points (i.e. firewalls and similar security solutions)
        - All sensitive data should be encrypted, both for network communication and data-at-rest
        - Use centralized identity access and management system, with multifactor authentication
        - Customers shouldn’t use encryption controlled by the vendor, eliminating risks to vendor-based insider threats, and supporting destruction using
        - Location is an important issue for backup data, as preserving it near an area with frequent natural disasters could be troublesome.
        - Cost would be of consideration, as it would impact net income.
        - Company reputation would reduce or increase risk with the company being backed up depending on what that reputation was. An organization may seek to incur greater costs to avoid the risk of associating with a company that has a poor reputation.
        - 📝Cryptographic erase: methods that permanently remove the cryptographic keys
        - Capture diagnostic and security data from cloud-based systems and store in your SIEM system
        - Ensure cloud configuration matches or exceeds your on-premise security requirements
        - Understand the cloud vendor's security strategy
    - Cloud shared responsibility by model:
        - 🥑Software as a Service (SaaS):
            - the vendor is responsible for all maintenance of the SaaS services
        - 🥑Platform as a Service (PaaS):
            - customers deploy apps that they’ve created or acquired, manage their apps, and modify config settings on the host
            - the vendor is responsible for maintenance of the host and the underlying cloud infrastructure
            - Cloud computing systems where the customer only provides application code for execution on a vendor-supplied computing platform are examples of platform as a service (PaaS) computing.
        - 🥑Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): 
            - IaaS models provide basic computing resources to customers
            - customers install OSs and apps and perform required maintenance
            - the vendor maintains cloud-based infra, ensuring that customers have access to leased systems
        - 🥑Identity as a service (IDaaS) provides capabilities such as account provisioning, management, authentication, authorization, reporting, and monitoring. 
- 3.5.7 Distributed systems
    - ❄️**Distributed computing environment (DCE)**: a collection of individual systems that work together to support a resource or provide a service 
    - DCEs are designed to support communication and coordination among their members in order to achieve a common function, goal, or operation
    - The primary security concern of a distributed computing environment (DCE) is the 📝interconnectedness of the components. This configuration could allow for error or 📝malware propagation as well. If an adversary compromises one component, it may grant them the ability to compromise other components in the collective through pivoting and lateral movement. 
    - Most DCEs have duplicate or concurrent components, are asynchronous, and allow for fail-soft or independent failure of components
    - DCE is AKA 📝concurrent computing, 📝parallel computing, and 📝distributed computing 
    - DCE solutions are implemented as client-server, three-tier, multi-tier, and peer-to-peer
    - Distributed control systems (DCSs) are typically used in industrial process plants where the need to gather data and implement control over a large-­scale environment from a single location is essential.
    - A DCE typically includes an 💥interface definition language (IDL). An IDL is a language used to define the interface between client and server processes or objects in a distributed system. Some examples of DCE IDL include
         -  🍖Remote procedure calls (RPC)
         -  🍖The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
         -  🍖Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
         -  🍖Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)
         -  🍖gRPC
         -  🍖Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
         -  🍖Web Services (SOAP and REST)
         -  🍖WebSockets
         -  🍖Apache thrift
    - Securing distributed systems:
        - in distributed systems, integrity is sometimes a concern because data and software are spread across various systems, often in different locations
        - Client/server model network is AKA a distributed system or distributed architecture 
            - ✏️security must be addressed everywhere instead of at a single centralized host 
            - ✏️processing and storage are distributed on multiple clients and servers, and all must be secured 
            - ✏️network links must be secured and protected
- 3.5.8 Internet of Things (IoT)
    - ❄️**Internet of things (IoT)**: a class of smart devices that are internet-connected in order to provide automation, remote control, or AI processing to appliances or devices 
        - An IoT device is almost always separate/distinct hardware used on its own or in conjunction with an existing system
        - IoT security concerns often relate to access and encryption
        - IoT biggest concern should be the long-term security, patching model and supportability of the IoT devices. 
        - IoT is often not designed with security as a core concept, resulting in security breaches; once an attacker has remote access to the device they may be able to pivot
        - Securing IoT:
            - 🏓deploy a distinct network for IoT equipment, kept separate and isolated (known as **three dumb routers**) 
            - 🏓keep systems patched 
            - 🏓limit physical and logical access 
            - 🏓monitor activity 
            - 🏓implement firewalls and filtering 
            - 🏓never assume IoT defaults are good enough, evaluate settings and config options, and make changes to optimize security while supporting business function
            - 🏓disable remote management and enable secure communication only (such as over HTTPS)
            - 🏓review IoT vendor to understand their history with reported vulnerabilities, response time to vulnerabilities and their overall approach to security
            - 🏓not all IoT devices are suitable for enterprise networks
            - 🏓Mirai malware affectes IoT, transforming them into a botnet
- 3.5.9 Microservices
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) constructs new applications or functions out of existing but separate and distinct software services. The resulting application is often new; thus, its security issues are unknown, untested, and unprotected. A
derivative of SOA is microservices.
    - ❄️**Microservices**: a feature of web-based solutions and derivative of SOA 
        - A microservice is simply one element, feature, capability, business logic, or function of a web app that can be called upon or used by other web apps
        - It is a software concept
        - microservices utilize loosely coupled services that communicate via lightweight protocols to accomplish specific tasks that are then combined to achieve overall goals.
        - Microservices are usually small and focused on a single operation, engineered with few dependencies, and based on fast, short-term development cycles (similar to Agile)
        - It is the conversion or transformation of a capability of one web application into a microservice that can be called upon by numerous other web applications. The relationship to an application programming interface (API) is that each microservice must have a clearly defined (and secured!) API to allow for I/O between multi-­microservices as well as to and from other applications.
        - Microservices are often created as a means to provide purpose-specific business capabilities through services that are independently deployed.
        - microservices are small and focused on a singular operation
        - microservices are designed with few dependencies
        - microservices are based on fast short-term development cycles (similar to Agile).
        - It is also common to deploy microservices based on immutable architecture. 
        - creating many discrete software objects and then binds them together using APIs is an example of a micro services architecture. Each of the component micro services performs a discrete task and then communicates with other micro services using APIs
        - Securing microservices: 
            - 🥩use HTTPS only 
            - 🥩encrypt everything possible and use routine scanning
            - 🥩closely aligned with microservices is the concept of shifting left, or addressing security earlier in the SDLC; also integrating it into the CI/CD pipeline 
            - 🥩consider the software supplychain or dependencies of libries used, when addressing updates and patching
- 3.5.10 Containerization
    - ❄️**Containerization**: AKA OS virtualization, is based on the concept of eliminating the duplication of OS elements in a virtual machine; instead each app is placed into a container that includes only the actual resources needed to support the enclosed app, and the common or shared OS elements are then part of the hypervisor
        - Containerization is able to provide 10 to 100 x more application density per physical server compared to traditional virtualization
        - Containerization or OS virtualization is based on the concept of eliminating the duplication of OS elements in a virtual machine.
        - Crafted to host a single application, including only the OS resources needed, and sharing a common binaries and libraries
        - Some containerization solutions allow for multiple concurrent applications withing a single container, whereas others are limited to one per container.
        - Many containerization solutions allow for customization of how much interaction applications in separate containers is allowed. 
        - the use of Docker is best described as a containerization technology
        - Vendors often have security benchmarks and hardening guidelines to follow to enhance container security
        - Securing containers: 
            - 🐍container challenges include the lack of isolation compared to a traditional infrastructure of physical servers and VMs
            - 🐍scan container images to reveal software with vulns
            - 🐍secure your registries: use access controls to limit who can publish images, or even access the registry
            - 🐍require images to be signed
            - 🐍harden container deployment including the OS of the underlying host, using firewalls, and VPC rules, and use limited access accounts
            - 🐍reduce the attack surface by minimizing the number of components in each container, and update and scan them frequently 
- 3.5.11 Serverless
    - ❄️**Serverless architecture** (AKA **function as a service (FaaS)**): a cloud computing concept where code is managed by the customer and the platform (i.e. supporting hardware and software) or servers are managed by the CSP
        - Applications developed on serverless architecture are similar to microservices, and each function is created to operate independently and automonomously
        - A serverless model, as in other CSP models, is a shared security model,and your org and the CSP share security responsibility
        - In a serverless computing model, the vendor does not expose details of the operating system to its customers. Therefore, the vendor retains full responsibility for configuring it securely under the shared responsibility model of cloud computing.
        - There is always a physical server running the code, but this execution model allows the software designer/architect/programmer/developer to focus on the logic of their code and not have to be concerned about the parameters or limitations of a specific server. This is also known as function as a service (FaaS).
        - 📝FaaS is a subcategory of platform as a service (PaaS)
        -  Serverless computing solutions like AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, and Google Cloud functions require less overhead when applications are designed from the ground up to leverage function as a service technology.

- ❄️**Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a concept where you manage and provision IT infrastructure using code rather than manual processes. 

- 3.5.12 Embedded systems
    - ❄️**Embedded systems**: any form of computing component added to an existing mechanical or electrical system for the purpose of providing automation, remote control, and/or monitoring; usually including a limited set of specific functions
        - Embedded systems can be a security risk because they are generally static, with admins having no way to update or address security vulns (or vendors are slow to patch)
        - An embedded system is a computer implemented as part of a larger system. The embedded system is typically designed around a limited set of specific functions in relation to the larger product of which it's a component. It may consist of the same components found in a typical computer system, or it may be a microcontroller.
        - Embedded systems focus on minimizing cost and extraneous features
        - Embedded systems are often in control of/associated with physical 📝 systems, and can have real-world impact
        - Because an embedded system is often in control of a mechanism in the physical world, a security breach could cause harm to people and property (aka cyber-­physical).
        - Securing embedded systems:
            - ebedded systems should be isolated from the internet, and from a private production network to minimize exposure to remote exploitation, remote control, and malware
            - use secure boot feature and physically protecting the hardware
     - ❄️**Cyber-physical systems** refer to devices that offer a computational means to control something in the physical world. In the past these might have been referred to as 🎵 embedded systems 🎵, but the category of cyber-physical seems to focus more on the physical world results rather than the computational aspects.
- 3.5.13 High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems
    - ❄️**High-performance computing (HPC)** systems: platforms designed to perform complex calculations/data manipulation at extremely high speeds (e.g. super computers or MPP (Massively Parallel Processing)); often used by large orgs, universities, or gov agencies
        - High-performance computing (HPC) systems are used when real-time or near-real-time processing of massive data is necessary for a particular task or application.
        - These applications can include scientific studies, industrial research, medical analysis, societal solutions, and commercial endeavors. This type of solution is composed of three main elements and each element must be able to provide equivalent capabilities in order to optimize overall performance
        - An HPC solution is composed of three main elements: 
            - 🐌compute resources 
            - 🐌network capabilities 
            - 🐌storage capacity
        - HPCs often implement real-time OS (RTOS)
             - **Real-time operating system (RTOS)** is designed to process or handle data as it arrives on the system with minimal latency or delay. An RTOS is usually stored on read-only memory (ROM) and is designed to operate in a hard real-time or soft real-time condition.
             - It minimizes latency and delay, storing code in ROM, and optimizing for mission-­critical operations
        - HPC systems are often rented, leased or shared, which can limit the effectiveness of firewalls and invalidate air gap solutions
        - Securing HPC systems:
            - deploy head nodes and route all outside traffic through them, isolating parts of a system 
            - "fingerprint" HPC systems to understand use, and detect anomalous behavior
- 3.5.14 Edge computing systems
    - ❄️**Edge computing**: philosophy of network design where data and compute resources are located as close as possible, at or near the network edge, to optimize bandwidth use while minimizing latency
    - In edge computing, the intelligence and processing are contained within each device. Thus, rather than having to send data off to a master processing entity, each device can process its own data locally.
    - Edge computing is a technology that involves placing infrastructure closer to the point of use. This approach offers several benefits such as reduced latency, improved performance for local processing, and reduced traffic to remote data centers or the cloud.
    - The architecture of edge computing performs computations closer to the data source, which is at or near the edge of the network.
        - Securing edge computing:
            - this technology creates additional network edges that result in increased levels of complexity
            - visibility, control, and correlation requires a Zero Trust access-based approach to address security on the LAN edge, WAN edge and cloud edge, as well as network management
            - edge-based computing devices,especially IoT devices, are often produced with limited security forethought
            - devices on your network, no matter where they reside, need to be configured, managed, and patched using a consistent policy and enforcement strategy
            - use intelligence from side-channel signals that can pick up hardware trojans and malicious firmware
            - attend to physical security 
            - deploy IDS on the network side to monitor for malicious traffic
            - in many scenarios, you are an edge customer, and likely will need to rely on a vendor for some of the security and vulnerability remediation

- ❄️**Fog computing** is another example of advanced computation architectures, which is also often used as an element in an IIoT deployment. Fog computing relies upon sensors, IoT devices, or even edge computing devices to collect data, and then transfer it back to a central location for processing. Thus, intelligence and processing is centralized.
    - Both edge and fog computing can often take advantage of or integrate the use of microcontrollers, embedded devices, static devices, cyber-physical systems, and IoT equipment.
  
- 3.5.15 Virtualized systems
    - ❄️**Virtualized systems**: used to host one or more OSs within the memory of a single host computer, or to run apps not compatible with the host OS
        - Securing virtualized systems:
            - the primary component in virtualization is a hypervisor which manages the VMs, virtual data storage, virtual network components
            - The hypervisor is responsible for coordinating access to physical hardware and enforcing isolation between different virtual machines running on the same physical platform.
            - the hypervisor represents an additional attack surface
            - The hypervisor runs within the virtualization platform and serves as the moderator between virtual resources and physical resources.
            - in virtualized environments, you need to protect both the VMs and the physical infrastructure/hypervisor
            - hypervisor admin accounts/credentials and service accounts are targets because they often provide access to VMs and their data; these accounts should be protected
            - virtual hosts should be hardened; to protect the host, avoid using it for anything other than hosting virtualized elements
            - virtualized systems should be security tested via vuln assessment and penetration testing
            - virtualization doesn't lessen the security management requirements of an OS, patch management is still required
            - be aware of VM Sprawl and Shadow IT
            - 🍍**VM Sprawl** occurs when organizations fail to plan their IT/IS needs and just deploy new systems, software, and VMs whenever their production needs demand it. This often results in obtaining underpowered equipment that is then over-
taxed by inefficient implementations of software and VMs.
            - 🍍**VM escape**: occurs when software within a guest OS is able to breach the isolation protection provided by the hypervisor
            - VM escape minimizaton:
                - keep highly sensitive systems and data on separate physical machines
                - keep all hypervisor software current with vendor-released patches
                - monitor attack, exposure and abuse indexes for new threats to virtual machines (which might be better protected); often, virtualization administrators have access to all virtuals
- 🔵**System on a Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit (IC) or chip that has all of the elements of a computer integrated into a single chip. This often includes the main CPU, RAM, a GPU, Wi-Fi, wired networking, peripheral interfaces (such as USB), and power management. In most cases, the only item missing from an SoC compared to a full computer is bulk storage. Often a bulk storage device must be attached or connected to the SoC to store its programs and other files, since the SoC usually contains only enough memory to retain its own firmware or OS.
    - The security risks of an SoC include the fact that the firmware or OS of an SoC is often minimal, which leaves little room for most security features.
    - A few devices that use an SoC include the mini-computer Raspberry Pi, fitness trackers, smart watches, and some smartphones.    
- 🔵**Static systems/environments** are applications, OSs, hardware sets, or networks that are configured for a specific need, capability, or function, and then set to remain unaltered.
     - A nonpersistent system or static system is a computer system that does not allow, support, or retain changes. Thus between uses and/or reboots, the operating environment and installed software are exactly the same. Changes may be blocked or simply discarded after each system use.
     - A nonpersistent system is able to maintain its configuration and security in spite of user attempts to implement change.
- 🔵**Parallel Data Systems**: . Systems designed to perform numerous calculations simultaneously include SMP, AMP, and MPP. Multicore, the ability to process multiple execution threads simultaneously, is often a key component of modern SMP, AMP, and MPP deployments in addition to standard single CPU systems.
     - 🍍Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) systems usually have independent processors, each with their own assigned instruction set, memory, and bus. AMP on its own is not quite suited for very large processing requirements.
     - 🍍Massive parallel processing (MPP) system: An MPP is usually constructed of numerous AMPs linked together. MPP systems can encompass thousands of processors. MPPs are managed by a central coordination system.
     - 🍍Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems: have multiple processors, but they share a common OS, bus, and memory resources. 
- 🔵**Peer-to-peer (P2P)**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies are networking and distributed application solutions that share tasks and workloads among peers.
 - 🔵**Grid Computing**:  Grid computing is a form of parallel distributed processing that loosely groups a significant number of processing nodes to work toward a specific processing goal. In many grid computing implementations, grid members can access the contents of the distributed work segments or divisions. This grid computing over the internet is not usually the best platform for sensitive operations. 
    -  🛑Isolation Breach: One of the main risks of grid computing is an isolation breach. An isolation breach in the distributed computing client could be catastrophic, allowing someone who compromises the controller to assume control of every device in the organization. 
- 🔵**Microcontrollers**: A microcontroller is similar to but less complex than a system on a chip (SoC). A microcontroller may be a component of an SoC. A microcontroller is a small computer consisting of a CPU (with one or more cores), memory, various input/output capabilities, RAM, and often nonvolatile storage in the form of flash or ROM/PROM/EEPROM. Examples include Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and FPGA.
    - ⚒️Arduino is an open source hardware and software organization that creates single-board 8-bit microcontrollers for building digital devices. An Arduino device has limited RAM, a single USB port, and I/O pins for controlling additional electronics (such as servo motors or LED lights), and does not include an OS or support networking. Instead, Arduino can execute C++ programs specifically written to its limited instruction set.
    - ⚒️Raspberry Pi is a popular example of a 64-bit microcontroller or a single-board computer, which includes its own custom OS, although many third-party OS alternatives are available. A Raspberry Pi, another microcontroller option, has significantly more processing power than Arduino, is not limited to executing C++ programs, supports networking, and is more expensive than Arduino.
    - ⚒️A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a flexible computing device intended to be programmed by the end user or customer. FPGAs are often used as embedded devices in a wide range of products, including industrial control systems (ICSs). FPGAs can be challenging to program and are often more expensive than other more limited solutions

[3.6](#3.6) Select and determine cryptographic solutions (OSG-9 Chpts 6,7)
- FIPS 140-2: Established to aid in the protection of digitally stored unclassified , yet sensitive information.

   - 🍍Hardware: e.g SafeNet Luna HSM (Thales), Gemalto SafeNet HSM (Thales), nShield HSM (Entrust), Ultimaco CryptoServer HSM
   - 🍍Software: OpenSSL FIPS Object Module, Microsoft Windows Crypto Modules, Bouncy Castle FIPS Modules
   - 🍍Cloud: Microsoft Azure Key Vault, Amazon Key Management Service (KMS), Google cloud Key Managment Service (KMS)
- **Level of Protection:** dictates that encryption keys must be secured at the same level of control or higher as the data they protect. Sensitivity of the data dictates this level of protection as defined in the org security policies.
- 3.6.1 Cryptographic lifecycle (e.g., keys, algorithm selection)
    - Keep **Moore’s Law** in mind (processing capabilities of state-of-the-art microprocessors double about every 2 years), and have appropriate governance controls in place to ensure that algorithms, protocols, and key lengths selected are sufficient to preserve the integrity of the cryptosystems for as long as necessary -- to keep secret information safe
    - Specify the cryptographic algorithms (such as AES, 3DES, and RSA) acceptable for use in an organization
    - Identify the acceptable key lengths for use with each algorithm based on the sensitivity of the info transmitted
    - Enumerate the secure transaction protocols (e.g. TLS) that may be used
    - As computing power goes up, the strength of cryptographic algorithms goes down; keep in mind the effective life of a certificate or cert template, and of cryptographic systems 
    - Beyond brute force, consider things like the discovery of a bug or an issue with an algorithm or system
    - NIST defines the following terms that are commonly used to describe algorithms and key lengths: 
        - approved (an algorithm that is specified as a NIST or FIPS recommendation) 
        - acceptable (algorithm + key length is safe today) 
        - deprecated (algorithm and key length is OK to use, but brings some risk) 
        - restricted (use of the algorithm and/or key length is deprecated and should be avoided) 
        - legacy (the algorithm and/or key length is outdated and should be avoided when possible) 
        - disallowed (algorithm and/or key length is no longer allowed for the indicated use)
- 3.6.2 Cryptographic methods (e.g., symmetric, asymmetric, elliptic curves, quantum)
    - 🔴**Symmetric** encryption: uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It is the process that uses the same key (or a simple transformation of it) for both encryption/decryption
        - symmetric encryption uses a 📝shared secret key available to all users of the cryptosystem 
        - symmetric encryption is faster than asymmetric encryption because smaller keys can be used for the same level of protection 
        - downside is that users or systems must find a way to securely share the key and hope the key is used only for the specified communication
        - symmetric encryption uses session keys. In TLS, both the server and the client communicate using an ephemeral symmetric session key. They exchange this key using asymmetric cryptography, but all encrypted content is protected using symmetric cryptography.
            - 🎈**Session key**: a symmetric encryption key generated for one-time use; usually requires a key encapsulation approach to eliminate key management issues
        - primarily employed to perform bulk encryption and provides only for the security service of confidentiality
        - 🧠Nonrepudiation requires the use of a public key cryptosystem to prevent users from falsely denying that they originated a message. Asymmetric cryptography is used for Nonrepudiation. Sender encrypt message (digital signature) with private key and receive decrypt message with sender's public key. This validates integrity and Nonrepudiation.
        - 🧠Nonrepudiation cannot be achieved with a symmetric cryptosystem, such as AES.
        - "same" is a synonym for symmetric 
        - "different" is a synonym for asymmetric 
        - total number of keys required to completely connect n parties using symmetric cryptography is given by this formula: 
            - **(n(n - 1)) / 2** 🥇
            - In a symmetric cryptosystem, a unique key exists for each pair of users. If for example in a 20 user symmetric key system and 1 user is compromised, **(n - 1)** key must be changed, meaning that the key that the user shared with each of the other 19 users must be changed.
            - ❄️**Block Ciphers**: Block ciphers operate on message "chunks" rather than on individual characters or bits.  Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64 bits, 128 bits). Examples: DES, 3DES, AES, Blowfish, Twofish. When a block cipher is used for encryption and decryption, a message is divided into blocks of 📝bits. A block cipher first separates the message into chunks of bits and then applies the algorithm to the entire message. A Binary digIT (bit) is the basic unit of information in computing and can have only one of two values, 0 or 1. Block ciphers can operate in various modes to enhance security and applicability:
                - 🍉ECB (Electronic Codebook): Encrypts each block 📝independently; not recommended due to security weaknesses. Only provide 📝confidentiality. Plaintext is divided into blocks. Each block is encrypted separately to produce the ciphertext blocks. It is susceptible to frequency analysis.
                - 🍉CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): Each plaintext block is 📝XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption, improving security. The first plaintext block is 📝XORed with an initialization vector (IV) before encryption.         Subsequent plaintext blocks are XORed with the previous ciphertext block. Ensures that identical plaintext blocks produce different ciphertext blocks and Adds diffusion to the encryption process. One important consideration when using CBC mode is that 📝errors propagate—­if one block is corrupted during transmission, it becomes impossible to decrypt that block and the next block as well. CBC also uses the Data Encryption Standard 📝(DES) algorithm.
                - 🍉Output Feedback (OFB) Mode: Converts a block cipher into a 📝synchronous stream cipher by generating a 📝keystream from the encryption of an initial value (IV) and XORing it with the plaintext. The block cipher encrypts an IV to produce a 📝keystream. The keystream is XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext. Error propagation is minimal; a bit error affects only the corresponding bit in the plaintext and can operate in parallel since encryption is independent of the plaintext. Weaknesses: Vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks if not combined with proper integrity checks. Requires secure IV management. Only provide 📝confidentiality. Output Feedback (OFB) also uses a combination of XOR and 📝DES encryption as well. 
                - 🍉CFB (Cipher Feedback): Convert block ciphers into 📝stream ciphers, encrypting smaller units of data. CFB mode operates on small units of data, such as bits or bytes, and can 📝recover from transmission errors more effectively than some other modes.  It uses the previous ciphertext block to influence the encryption of the current plaintext block. Although CFB mode uses a block cipher, it effectively functions as a stream cipher by generating a keystream that is XORed with the plaintext. Strenghts include error Propagation, Self-Synchronizing i.e Capable of recovering from transmission errors if the ciphertext is corrupted or lost. Allows for encryption of small units of data (like individual bytes) rather than fixed-size blocks. While more secure than ECB, CFB mode still needs to be combined with secure key management practices to avoid vulnerabilities. Cipher Feedback (CFB) is 📝just like CBC, except it is a stream cipher rather than a block cipher.
          - 💥CBC, CFB, and OFB all use a random value to hide patterns by randomizing the values through the use of an initialization vector before encrypting.
                - 🍉CTR (Counter Mode): Encrypts data by 📝combining plaintext with an encrypted counter, 📝turning a block cipher into a stream cipher by encrypting successive values of a counter and XORing the result with the plaintext. The block cipher encrypts a counter value, which is incremented for each block. The encrypted counter value (keystream) is XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext. Supports parallel encryption and decryption and Allows random access to encrypted data blocks. Weaknesses: The counter must never repeat for the same key to maintain security. Only provide 📝confidentiality. Counter mode allows you to break an encryption or decryption operation into multiple independent steps. This makes Counter mode well suited for use in 📝parallel computing.
                - 🍉Galois/Counter Mode (GCM): Combines the Counter mode for encryption with Galois mode for authentication, providing both 📝confidentiality and 📝integrity. Uses CTR mode for encryption. Adds an authentication tag generated using a polynomial hash function (Galois field multiplication) to ensure data integrity. Provides authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) and Ensures both confidentiality and data integrity. Weaknesses: Requires careful implementation to avoid nonce reuse, which can compromise security. Used in modern protocols like TLS and IPsec to secure data with both encryption and authentication.
                - 🍉Counter with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CCM): Combines Counter mode for encryption with CBC-MAC for authentication to provide AEAD. Encrypts data using Counter mode. Computes a CBC-MAC tag over the plaintext and additional authenticated data (AAD). Strengths: Provides both encryption and message authentication, providing both 📝confidentiality and 📝integrity. Suitable for environments where both encryption and data integrity are required. Weaknesses: Slightly more complex than using GCM. Requires careful nonce management to ensure security. Example: Used in various standards, including IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and some versions of IPsec.
            - ❄️**Stream Ciphers**: Encrypts data one bit or byte at a time. Examples: RC4, ChaCha20.
                -  Bit-by-Bit Encryption: Unlike block ciphers that encrypt data in fixed-size blocks, stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time.
                -  They generate a pseudo-random key stream that is combined with the plaintext using an XOR operation to produce the ciphertext.
                -  They are generally simpler and faster than block ciphers, making them suitable for applications requiring high-speed encryption.
                -  They are faster and can be more efficient than block ciphers for certain applications, especially when hardware resources are limited.
                -  They typically have lower latency compared to block ciphers, making them suitable for real-time applications.
                -  Disadvantage is that if the key stream is reused (keystream reuse), it can compromise security, as it makes the cipher vulnerable to attacks. Ensuring that the same key stream is not reused is critical and can complicate key management. 
    - 🔴**Hybrid encryption system**: a system that uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption
    - 🔴**Asymmetric** encryption: process that uses different keys for encryption and decryption, and in which the decryption key is computationally not possible to determine given the encryption key itself
        - uses public and private key
        - In an asymmetric cryptosystem, the sender of a message encrypts the message using the recipient's public key. The recipient may then decrypt that message using their own private key, which only they should possess.
        - total number of keys required to completely connect n parties using assymmetric cryptography is given by this formula: 
            - **n(2)** 🥇 Asymmetric cryptosystems use a pair of keys for each user. E.g with 1,000 users, the system will require 2,000 keys.
        - Asymmetric (AKA public key, since one key of a pair is available to anybody) algorithms provide convenient key exchange mechanisms and are scalable to very large numbers of users (addressing the two most significant challenges for users of symmetric cryptosystems) 
        - Asymmetric cryptosystems avoid the challenge of sharing the same secret key between users, by using pairs of public and private keys to allow secure communication without the overhead of complex key distribution
        - 📁**Public key**: one part of the matching key pair, which can be shared or published
        - Besides the public key, there is a private key that should remain private and protected
        - Private key secrecy and integrity of an asymmetric encryption process are entirely dependent upon protecting the value of the private key
        - While asymmetric encryption is slower, it is best suited for sharing between two or more parties 
        - Most common asymmetric cryptosystems in use today:    
            - 🐍**Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)**:Rivest, Shamir, & Adleman (RSA) is an asymmetric algorithm that uses public and private keys. RSA is often used to distribute symmetric encryption keys because asymmetric encryption is computationally expensive and can’t be used to efficiently encrypt large amounts of data. When using asymmetric algorithms like RSA, if a message is encrypted using the private key, it can only be decrypted using the public key; this rule also applies in reverse. If a message is encrypted with the public key, it can only be decrypted using the private key.
            - 🐍**Diffie-Hellman**: Diffie-Hellman (DH) is an asymmetric algorithm. Mr. Diffie and Mr. Hellman wrote a paper in 1976 that theorized public and private keys. However, the algorithm they came up with does not work that way. It is an algorithm for the purpose of 📝exchanging a symmetric key only. They were unsuccessful in finding the math to use public and private keys. RSA did that in 1977.
            - 🐍**ElGamal** - The major disadvantage of the ElGamal cryptosystem is that it 📝doubles the length of any message it encrypts.
            - 🐍**Eliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC)** - The elliptic curve cryptosystem requires significantly 📝shorter keys to achieve encryption that would be the same strength as encryption achieved with the RSA encryption algorithm. A 3,072-­bit RSA key is cryptographically equivalent to a 256-­bit elliptic curve cryptosystem key.
        - **Scenario**: If 🅰️ wants to send a message to 🅱️. 🅰️ must encrypt the message using 🅱️’s public key so that only 🅱️ can decrypt it using 🅱️ private key. If 🅰️ encrypted the message with his own public key, 🅱️ would need to know 🅰️’s private key to decrypt the message. If 🅰️ encrypted it with his own private key, any user could decrypt the message using 🅰️’s freely available public key. 🅰️ could not encrypt the message using 🅱️’s private key because 🅰️ does not have access to it. If 🅰️ did, any user could decrypt it using 🅱️’s freely available public key.

- 3.6.3 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    - 📂**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: hierarchy of trust relationships permitting the combination of asymmetric and symmetric cryptography along with hashing and digital certificates (giving us hybrid cryptography)
        - Digital certificates contain public keys that belong to someone or something (e.g. a web server). The standard package that holds the public keys is the ITU-TSS X.509 format. There are several other fields within the certificate such as the subject’s name and the Certificate Authorities (CA) signature. The CA is the trusted source of certificates. They (human and computer combined) are charged with knowing for sure who the key will belong to and then publishing the X.509 certificate. 
    - The key/certificate life-cycle management consists of six phases:
        - 🧭pre-certification
        - 🧭initialization
        - 🧭certification
        - 🧭operational
        - 🧭suspension
        - 🧭termination.  
        - The purpose of a digital certificate is to provide the general public with an authenticated copy of the certificate subject's public key.
        - The last step of the certificate creation process is the digital signature. During this step, the certificate authority signs the certificate using its own private key.
        - When an individual receives a copy of a digital certificate, the person verifies the authenticity of that certificate by using the CA's public key to validate the digital signature contained on the certificate.
        - A PKI issues certificates to computing devices and users, enabling them to apply cryptography (e.g., to send encrypted email messages, encrypt websites or use IPsec to encrypt data communications)
        - 📝X.509 standards governs digital certificates and the public key infrastructure (PKI). It defines the appropriate content for a digital certificate and the processes used by certificate authorities to generate and revoke certificates.
        - 📝X.500 standards governs directory access
        - Many vendors provide PKI services; you can run a PKI privately and solely for your own org, you can acquire certificates from a trusted third-party provider, or you can do both (which is common) 
        - A PKI is made up of 
            - 🎈**certification authorities (CAs)**: servers that provide one or more PKI functions, such as providing policies or issuing certificates. A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted party that validates or signs the certificate of the user. Other parties trust this signed certificate because they trust the certificate authority. Some popular CAs include DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, and GlobalSign.
            - 🎈**A Registration Authority (RA)** acts as the broker between a user requesting a new certificate and the CA. The RA verifies the identity of the user before the CA generates and signs the certificate. When you request a certificate, you'll typically interact with an RA, which may be a part of the CA itself or a separate entity that works with the CA. Once the RA has verified all your information, it passes this confirmation to the CA.
            - 🎈certificates: issued to other certification authorities or to devices and users 
            - 🎈policies and procedures: such as how the PKI is secured, and 
            - 🎈templates: a predefined configuration for specific uses, such as a web server template
            - 🎈Certificate Revocation List CRL: is a list maintained by a Certificate Authority (CA) that contains identifiers for certificates that have been revoked before their scheduled expiration date. Certificates may only be added to a certificate revocation list by the certificate authority that created the digital certificate. Certificate Authority (CA) administrators can invalidate a certificate before its expiration date by posting it to the CRL. When a device is authenticating a certificate before using the public key it contains, it can check the published CRL to verify it has not been revoked. These certificates might be revoked for various reasons, such as being compromised, having been issued incorrectly, or no longer being needed. Delta CRLs: To efficiently handle updates, delta CRLs can be used to list only the changes (i.e., new revocations or reinstatements) since the last full CRL was issued. The certificate revocation list contains
                - 🥥Serial Number: The unique identifier of the revoked certificate.
                - 🥥Revocation Date: The date on which the certificate was revoked.
                - 🥥Revocation Reason: The reason for the revocation, such as key compromise, CA compromise, affiliation change, or cessation of operation.
                - 🥥Issuer Information: Details about the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the CRL.
                - 🥥Next Update Date: The date when the next CRL is expected to be published.
                - 🥥CRL Number: A unique identifier for the CRL itself, which helps in tracking and referencing different versions of the list. 
        - There are other components and concepts you should know for the exam:
            - A PKI can have multiple tiers:    
                - 🔨single tier means you have one or more servers that perform all the functions of a PKI 
                - 🔨two tiers means there is an offline root CA (a server that issues certificates to the issuing CAs but remains offline most of the time) in one tier, and issuing CAs (the servers that issue certificates to computing devices and users) in the other tier
                - servers in the second tier are often referred to as intermediate CAs or subordinate CAs
                - 🔨three tier means you can have CAs that are responsible only for issuing policies (and they represent the second tier in a three-tier hierarchy)
                    - in such a scenario, the policy CAs should also remain offline and be brought online only as needed
            - Generally, the more tiers, the more security (but proper configuration is critical)
                - the more tiers you have, the more complex and costly the PKI is to build and maintain
            - A PKI should have a certificate policy and a certificate practice statement (CSP)
                - certificate policy: documents how your org handles items like requestor identities, the uses of certificates and storage of private keys 
                - CSP: documents the security configuration of your PKI and is usually available to the public
            - Besides issuing certificates, a PKI has other duties: 
                - a PKI needs to be able to provide certificate revocation information to clients. Note: Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) introduce an inherent latency to the certificate expiration process due to the time lag between CRL distributions.
                - if an administrator revokes a certificate that has been issued, clients must be able to get that info from your PKI
                - storage of private keys and info about issued certificates (can be stored in a database or a directory)
                    - 🍊The PFX format is most closely associated with Windows systems that store certificates in binary format. File Extension are typically .pfx or .p12. PFX typically contains a 📝private key, a 📝certificate, and potentially a certificate chain in a single file. Used for importing/exporting certificates and private keys in a single file, often in Windows environments.
                    - 🍊P7B format is used for Windows systems storing files in text format. P7B: Contains only certificates (the certificate chain), not private keys. It can be base64-encoded with headers and footers (e.g., -----BEGIN PKCS7-----), or binary. Used primarily for handling certificates and 📝certificate chains, not for ⛔private keys, and is often used in Windows and Java environments. File Extension typically .p7b or .p7c.
                    - 🍊The PEM format is another text format that is base64 ASCII-encoded. PEM usually represents individual components (like 📝separate files for private keys and certificates). File Extension are typically .pem, .crt, .cer, or .key (depending on the contents). PEM is common in Unix/Linux environments and for tasks requiring separate certificate and key files.
            - PKI uses LDAP when integrating digital certs into transmissions
      - 🔥The process of issuing certificates by a public Certificate Authority (CA):
          - 1. Certificate Request: Submission of Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the CA. The CSR includes the applicant's public key and identifying information. 
            2.  Certificate Authority Verification/Validation: The CA performs the necessary checks to ensure that the applicant’s identity and credentials are valid. This could involve verifying domain ownership, business registration, or other relevant details.
            3.  Certificate Generation: The CA creates the certificate by embedding the applicant’s public key and identifying information into the certificate template. The certificate also includes details about the CA, the certificate’s validity period, and the certificate’s serial number.
            4.  Signing: The CA digitally signs the certificate using its private key. This digital signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the certificate, allowing recipients to trust the certificate.
            5.  Certificate Distribution: The signed certificate is sent back to the applicant. The applicant can now install the certificate on their server or device as needed.
            6.  Publishing: The certificate is often published in a publicly accessible repository or directory, such as a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or an online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder, so that other parties can verify its validity. The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) eliminates the latency inherent in the use of certificate revocation lists by providing a means for real-time certificate verification. The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) provides real-time query/response services to digital certificate users. This overcomes the latency inherent in the traditional certificate revocation list download and cross-check process. 
            7.  End-User Verification: Users and systems verify the certificate’s validity by checking the CA's digital signature against the CA’s public key. They also verify that the certificate is not expired or revoked by consulting the CRL or OCSP responder.
            8.  Key Considerations: Trust Model: The CA operates within a trust model where its certificate is trusted by browsers, operating systems, and applications. Trust in the CA’s ability to accurately validate and issue certificates is crucial.
    
- 3.6.4 Key management practices
    - **Key management practices**: include safeguards surrounding the creation, distribution, storage, destruction, recovery, and escrow of secret keys
        - Cryptography can be used as a security mechanism to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability only if keys are not compromised
        - Three main methods are used to exchange secret keys: 
            - 🐌offline distribution
            - 🐌public key encryption, and 
            - 🐌the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm
            - 🐌Quantum Key Distribution: 🥇 a secure communication that involves components of quantum mechanics. Enables a party to generate a shared random key known only to them. This secret key can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. it has the ability to detect eavesdropping by any 3rd party trying to gain knowledge of the key. eavesdropper interception introduces detectable anomalies. Not the same as quantum cryptography. it relies on having an authenticated classical channel of communication. it means the parties have already exchanged symmetric keys of sufficient lenght or public keys of suffcient security level. Only used for key distribution and not to transmit data. used in high security scenarios.
        - Key management can be difficult with symmetric encryption but is much simpler with asymmetric encryption
        - There are several tasks related to key management:
            - ✴️**Key**: the input that controls the operation of the cryptographic algorthm, determining the behavior of the algorithm and permis the reliable encyrption and decryption of the message
            - ✴️**Key pair**: matching set of one public and one private key
            - ✴️**Key Creation**: Encryption keys should be generated using FIPS 140-2/3 validated modules
            - ✴️**Key generation**: the process of creating a new encryption/decryption key
            - ✴️**Key distribution**: the process of sending a key to a user or system; it must be secure and it must be stored in a secure way on the computing device
                - keys are stored before and after distribution; when distributed to a user, it can't hang out on a user's desktop
            - Keys shouldn't be in cleartext outside the crypography device. Encrypt keys with a sepereate encryption key before distributing to other parties.
            - Key distribution and maintenance should be automated (and hidden from the user)
            - Keys should be backed up!
            - ✴️**Key Storage**: Keys should never be stored in plain text.  This includes keys in volatile and persistent memory.
            - ✴️**Key Usage**: AUP determines guard rails for key usage
            - ✴️**Key Destruction**: Removal of an encryption key from its operational location
            - ✴️**Key Deletion**: Removing any information that can be used to reconstruct the key e.g device wipe in MDM such as Airwatch & MS Intune
            - ✴️**Key escrow**: process or entity that can recover lost or corrupted cryptographic keys. It is a process by which keys (asymmetric or symmetric) are placed in a trusted storage agent's custody, for later retrieval. Copies of keys are held by a trusted 3rd party in a secure environment. Comes up in conversations around disasater recovery, business continuity, law enforcement access, regulatory compliance etc
            - ✴️**Key Recovery:** Circumstances where you need to recover a key for a particular user, without that users cooperation such as termination or key loss. It is also the process of reconstructing an encryption key from the cyphertext alone; if there is a workable key recovery system, it means the algorithm is not secure.
                - **multiparty key recovery**: when two or more entities are required to reconstruct or recover a key
                - **m of n control**: 🥇 you designate a group of (n) people as recovery agents, but only need subset (m) of them for key recovery. M of N Control requires that a minimum number of agents (M) out of the total number of agents (N) work together to perform high-­security tasks. M of N Control is an example of a split knowledge technique, but not all split knowledge techniques are used for key escrow. In an m of n control system, at least m of n possible escrow agents must collaborate to retrieve an encryption key from the escrow database.
                - **split custody**: enables two or more people to share access to a key (e.g. for example, two people each hold half the password to the key)
            - Key rotation: rotate keys (retire old keys, implement new) to reduce the risks of a compromised key having access
            - Key states:
                - suspension: temporary hold
                - revocation: permanently revoked
                - expiration
                - destruction
            - See NIST 800-57, Part 1
- 3.6.5 Digital signatures and digital certificates
    - **Digital signatures**: provide proof that a message originated from a particular user of a cryptosystem, and ensures that the message was not modified while in transit between two parties
        - A digital signature is a hash of the file/message that is encrypted with the sender's private key. The receiver can decrypt the hash using the sender's public key. If verification of the hash is successful after decryption, it would prove the source of the file/message, since the sender is the only entity with a copy of the private key. Digital signatures assure the recipient that the message has not been tampered with during transmission by comparing the decrypted hash with the hash generated by the receiver.
        - Digital signatures rely on a combination of two major concepts — public key cryptography, and hashing functions 
        - Digitally signed messages assure the recipient that the message truly came from the claimed sender, enforcing nonrepudiation
        - Digitally signed messages assure the recipient that the message was not altered while in transit; protecting against both malicious modification (third party altering message meaning), and unintentional modification (faults in the communication process) 
        - Digital signature process does not provide confidentiality in and of itself (only ensures integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation)
        - Electronic signatures, prove that the signature was provided by the intended signer. Electronic signatures are intended to ensure that electronic records are "trustworthy, reliable, and generally equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures executed on paper." An electronic signature (e-signature) is a broad term that refers to any electronic means used to indicate agreement or approval on a digital document or transaction. It can include various forms, such as typed names, scanned images of handwritten signatures, or click-to-sign methods. A digital signature is a specific type of electronic signature that uses cryptographic techniques to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of a digital document or message. 
- 3.6.6 Digital Non-repudiation
    - Here non-repudiation refers to methods ensuring certainty about data origins; in general, the inability to deny
    - Non-repudiation of origin: sender cannot deny having sent a particular message
    - Non-repudiation of delivery: receiver cannot say they have received a different message (other than what they actually received)
    - Most common method of non-repudiation is digital signatures
    - Digital signatures rely on certificates
    - If a digital signature was verified with the public key of the sender, then we know that it was created using the sender's private key. If 🅰️ wants to digitally sign a message he’s sending to 🅱️ so that 🅱️ can be sure the message came from 🅰️ without modification while in transit. 🅰️ should encrypt the message digest with 🅰️'s own private key. When 🅱️ receives the message, 🅱️ will decrypt the digest with 🅰️’s public key and then compute the digest. If the two digests match, 🅱️ can be assured that the message truly originated from 🅰️.
    - Private key should only be known to the sender, so the verification proves to the recipient that the signature came from the sender, providing origin authentication 
    - The recipient (or anyone else) can demonstrate that process to a third party providing nonrepudiation
    - Data encryption provides confidentiality
- 3.6.7 Integrity (e.g., hashing)
    - Hash Functions have a very simple purpose — they take a potentially long message and generate a unique output value derived from the content of the message called a **Message Digest**
        - hash function implements encryption with a specified algorithm, but without a key
        - Provides a fixed-size hash value from variable-length input, used for ensuring data integrity.
        - used to ensure message sent by the originator is the same one received by recipient
        - input can be of any length. They take variable-length input.
        - output has a fixed length 
        - the hash function is relatively easy to compute for any input 
        - the hash function is one-way, meaning it is extremely difficult to determine the input given the hash function output. They are irreversible.
        - the hash function should be collision-resistant, meaning it is extremely hard to find two messages that produce the same hash value output. It is very difficult to find two messages with the same hash value.
        - 📝hashes are used for storing passwords, with email, and for file download integrity verification
    - Hashing and integrity: if the hash generated by sender, and separately by the receiver match, then we have integrity
    - **Cryptographic Hash function**: process or function that transforms an input plaintext into a unique value called a hash (or hash value); note that they do not use cryptographic algorithms, as hashes are one-way functions where it's infeasible to determine the plaintext; Message digests are an example of cryptographic hash.
     - 🎈The output of a hash function must be a fixed length, not any length.
     - 🎈Hash functions must also be one-way
     - 🎈Hash functions must be collision resistant
     - 🎈Hash functions must be relatively easy to compute.
    - **Cryptographic Salt** values are added to the passwords in password files before hashing to defeat rainbow table and dictionary attacks.  Rainbow-table attacks are offline password attacks. The salt is a random value added to a password before it is hashed by the operating system. The salt is then stored in a password file with the hashed password. This increases the complexity of cryptanalytic attacks by negating the usefulness of attacks that use precomputed hash values, such as rainbow tables. Salting adds random text to the password before hashing in an attempt to defeat automated password cracking attacks that use precomputed values. 

[3.7](#3.7) Understand methods of cryptanalytic attacks (OSG-9 Chpts 7,14,21)
- 📗**Cryptanalysis** is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key. Cryptanalysis is also referred to as codebreaking or cracking the code. The ciphertext is generally the easiest part of a cryptosystem to obtain and, therefore, is an important part of cryptanalysis. Depending on what information is available and what type of cipher is being analyzed, cryptanalysts can follow one or more attack models to crack a cipher.
- 3.7.1 Brute force
    - 🍮**Brute force**: an attack that attempts every possible valid combination for a key or password
        - they involve using massive amounts of processing power to methodically guess the key used to secure cryptographic communications.  In a brute-force attack, the attacker simply tries all possible key combinations.
        - An attacker has intercepted a large amount of data that was all encrypted with the same algorithm and encryption key. With no further information they can attempt a brute force attack.
        - 📝Rainbow tables contain precomputed hash values for commonly used passwords and may be used to increase the efficiency of password-­cracking attacks.
- 3.7.2 Ciphertext only
    - 🍮**Ciphertext only**: an attack where you only have the 📝encrypted ciphertext message at your disposal (not the plaintext)
        - if you have enough ciphertext samples, the idea is that you can decrypt the target ciphertext based on the samples
        - one technique proves helpful against simple ciphers is 📝frequency analysis (counting the number of times each letter appears in the ciphertext)
        - An attacker without any special access to the system would only be able to perform ciphertext-­only attacks.
- 3.7.3 Known plaintext
    - 🍮**Known plaintext**: in this attack, the attacker has a copy of the 📝encrypted message along with the 📝plaintext message used to generate the ciphertext (the copy); this knowledge greatly assists the attacker in breaking weaker codes.
         - 🛑In a chosen plaintext attack, the attacker has the ability to choose the plaintext to be encrypted.
         - Known plaintext and chosen plaintext attacks require the ability to encrypt data.
- 3.7.4 Frequency analysis
    - 🍮**Frequency analysis**: an attack where the characteristics of a language are used to defeat substitution ciphers
        - for example in English, the letter "E" is the most common, so the most common letter in an encrypted cyphertext could be a substitution for "E"
        - An attacker has intercepted a large amount of data that was all encrypted with the same algorithm and encryption key. With no further information they can attemt a frequency analysis attack
        - other examples might include letters that appear twice in sequence, as well as the most common words used in a language 
- 3.7.5 Chosen ciphertext
    - 🍮**Chosen ciphertext**: in a chosen ciphertext attack, the attacker has access to 📝one or more ciphertexts and their plaintexts; i.e. the attacker has the 📝ability to decrypt chosen portions of the ciphertext message, and use the decrypted portion to discover the key. Chosen ciphertext attacks require 📝access to the algorithm and work by having the attacker perform encryption that results in an expected ciphertext. Known plaintext and chosen plaintext attacks require the ability to encrypt data. In a chosen ciphertext attack, the attacker can choose the ciphertext output
    - 🍮**Differential cryptanalysis**: a type of chosen plaintext attack, and a general form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to 📝block ciphers, but also to 📝stream ciphers and cryptographic 📝hash functions; in the broadest sense, it is the study of how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output; advanced methods such as differential cryptanalysis are types of chosen plaintext attacks
        - as an example, an attacker may try to get the receiver to decrypt modified ciphertext, looking for that modification to cause a predictable change to the plaintext
- 3.7.6 Implementation attacks
    - 🍮**Implementation attack**: attempts to exploit 📝weaknesses in the implementation of a cryptography system
        - focuses on exploiting the software code, not just errors or flaws but the methodology employed to program the encryption system
        - in this type of attack, attackers look for weaknesses in the implementation, such as a software bug or outdated firmware
- 3.7.7 Side-channel: Side-channel attacks seek to use information about system activity and retrieve information that is actively being encrypted
    - 🍮**Side-channel**: these attacks seek to use the way computer systems generate characteristic footprints of activity, such as changes in processor utilization, power consumption, or electromagnetic radiation to monitor system activity and retrieve information that is actively being encrypted
        - similar to an implementation attack, side-channel attacks look for weaknesses outside of the core cryptography functions themselves
        - Side-channel attacks seek to use information about system activity and retrieve information that is actively being encrypted. 
        - a side-channel attack could target a computer’s CPU, or attempt to gain key information about the environment during encryption or decryption by looking for electromagnetic emissions or the amount of execution time required during decryption
        - side-channel characteristics information are often combined together to try to break down the cryptography
        - timing attack is an example
- 3.7.8 Fault-Injection
    - 🍮**Fault-Injection**: the attacker attempts to compromise the integrity of a cryptographic device by causing some type of external fault 
        - for example, using high-voltage electricity, dry ice, high or low temperature, or other factors to cause a malfunction that undermines the security of the device.
        - Fault injection attacks require physical access to the facility.
- 3.7.9 Timing
    - 🍮**Timing**: timing attacks are an example of a side-channel attack where the attacker measures precisely how long cryptographic operations take to complete, gaining information about the cryptographic process that may be used to undermine its security.
        - By analyzing these timing variations, an attacker can infer details about the cryptographic keys or the data being processed.
        - If an encryption algorithm takes longer to process certain values or operations due to conditional statements or variable-length operations, an attacker might exploit these timing differences to gain insights into the key or plaintext.
             - 🍓**Race condition**: The exploitation of the reliance of a system’s behavior on the sequence of events that occur externally. Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTOU) attack (attacker exploits the difference in time btw when a security control is verified and the data protected by the control is actually used). 
- 3.7.10 Man-in-the-middle (MITM)
    - 🍮**Man-in-the-middle (MITM) (AKA on-path)**: in this attack a malicious individual sits between two communicating parties and intercepts all communications (including the setup of the cryptographic session) 
        - attacker responds to the originator's initialization requests and sets up a secure session with the originator 
        - attacker then establishes a second secure session with the intended recipient using a different key and posing as the originator 
        - attacker can then "sit in the middle" of the communication and read all traffic as it passes between the two parties
        - Trusted paths that secure network traffic from capture and link encryption are both ways to help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. 
   - 🍮**Meet-in-the-Middle**: A Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cryptographic attack that targets symmetric key encryption algorithms, specifically when dealing with scenarios where the brute-force search space is reduced by exploiting the structure of the encryption process. The attack is used to efficiently break encryption schemes by reducing the time complexity compared to a naive brute-force approach.
        - A meet-in-the-middle attack is an attack against cryptographic algorithms that use multiple rounds of encryption.
        - The Meet-in-the-Middle attack is typically used in situations involving two rounds of encryption or decryption, such as in double encryption scenarios.
        - It works by splitting the problem into two separate problems and then combining the results to find the solution more efficiently than brute-forcing through all possible key combinations.
  - 🍮**Replay Attack**: In a replay attack, the malicious individual intercepts an encrypted message between two parties (often a request for authentication) and then later replays the captured message to open a new session. Challenge-response protocols and the use of ephemeral session keys also provide protection against replay attacks. Replay attacks can be used against cryptographic algorithms that do not incorporate temporal (time-based) protections.
- 3.7.11 Pass the hash
    - 🍮**Pass the hash (PtH)**: a technique where an attacker captures a password hash (as opposed to the password characters) and then simply passes it through for authentication and potentially lateral access to other networked systems 
        - the threat actor doesn’t need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plain text password
        - PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, as the passwords hash remains static for every session until the password is rotated
        - 📝NTLM is known to be susceptible to pass-­the-­hash attacks
        - attackers commonly obtain hashes by scraping a system’s active memory and other techniques.
        - MIMIKATZ is a popular tool to exploit pass the hash on Active Directory accounts
        - Pass-the-hash attacks (PtH) often rely on dumped local account databases (the SAM), capturing credentials from the network while they are in transit or from active memory.
- 3.7.12 🍮**Kerberos exploitation**
    - 🍓**Overpass the Hash**: alternative to the PtH attack, used when 🧠NTLM is disabled on the network (AKA pass the key) 
    - 🍓**Pass the Ticket**: in this attack, attackers attempt to harvest tickets held in the lsass.exe process and if succesful, is able to move laterally using authenticated credentials. In a Pass the Ticket attack, an attacker acquires a valid ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or session key from a compromised account or system and uses it to authenticate and impersonate a legitimate user. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to other systems and move laterally within the network without the need for further authentication. It is a common technique used in advanced persistent threats (APTs) to maintain persistent access and expand control within a network.
    - 🍓**Silver Ticket**: a silver ticket uses the captured NTLM hash of a service account to create a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket (the silver ticket grants the attacker all the privileges granted to the service account) 
    - 🍓**Golden Ticket**: if an attacker obtains the hash of the Kerberos service account (📝KRBTGT), they can create tickets at will within Active Directory (this provides so much power it is referred to as having a golden ticket) 
    - 🍓**Kerberos Brute-Force**: attackers use the Python script kerbrute.py on Linux, and Rubeus on Windows systems; tools can guess usernames and passwords 
    - 🍓**ASREPRoast**: ASREPRoast identifies users that don’t have Kerberos preauthentication enabled or not enforced in AD. This can be discovered using tools such as GetNPUsers from the Impacket suite. The name "ASREPRoast" is derived from the combination of "AS-REP" (Authentication Service Response) and "Roast" (a term used to describe the process of extracting and cracking hashes).
    - 🍓**Kerberoasting**: kerberoasting collects encrypted ticket-granting service (TGS) tickets
- 3.7.13 Ransomeware
    - 🍮**Ransomware**: a type of malware that weaponizes cryptography 
        - using many of the same techniques as other types of malware, ransomware gens an encryption key, and encrypts critical files 
        - this encryption renders the data inaccessible to the authorized user or anyone else other than the malware author 
        - often threatning to publically release sensitive data if ransome is not paid 
        - 2020 study, 56% of orgs suffered a ransomeware attack, 27% of orgs who reported an attack chose to pay, on average ~$1.1m 
        - seek legal advice prior to engaging with ransomware authors

[3.8](#3.8) Apply security principles to site and facility design (OSG-9 Chpt 10)

- **Secure facility plan**: outlines the security needs of your organization and emphasizes methods or mechanisms to employ to provide security, developed through risk assessment and critical path analysis
    - 🔮**Critical Path Analysis (CPA)**: a systematic effort to identify relationships between mission-critical applications, processes, and operations and all the necessary supporting components
    - 🔮**Technology Convergence**: During CPA, evaluate potential technology convergence: the tendency for various technologies, solutions, utilities, and systems to evolve and merge over time, which can result in a single point of failure
    - A secure facility plan is based on a layered defense model
    - Site selection should take into account cost, location, and size (but security should always take precedence), that the building can withstand local extreme weather events, vulnerable entry points, and exterior objects that could conceal break-ins
- Facility Design: 
    - The top priority of security should always be the protection of the life and safety of personnel
    - In the US, follow the guidelines and requirements from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    - 🔮**Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)**: a well-established school of thought on "secure architecture" - an archiectural approach to building and space design that emphasizes passive features to reduce the likelihood of criminal activity
        - core principle of CPTED is that the design of the physical environment can be managed/manipulated, and crafted with intention in order to create behavioral effects or changes in people present in those areas that result in reduction of crime as well as a reduction of the fear of crime
        - CPTED stresses three main principles:
            - **🐤natural access control**: the subtle guidance of those entering and leaving a building
                - make the entrance point obvious
                - create internal security zones
                - areas of the same access level should be open, but restricted/closed areas should seem more difficult to access
            - **🐤natural surveillance**: any means to make criminals feel uneasy through increased opportunities to be observed
                - walkways/stairways are open, open areas around entrances
                - areas should be well lit
            - **🐤natural territorial reinforcement**: attempt to make the area feel like an inclusive, caring community
    - Overall goal is to deter unauthorized people from gaining access to a location (or a secure portion), prevent unauthorized personnel from hiding inside or around the location, and prevent unauthorized from committing crime
    - There are several smaller activities tied to site and facility design, such as upkeep and maintenance: if property is run down or appears to be in disrepair, it gives attackers the impression that they can act with impunity on the property

[3.9](#3.9) Design site and facility security controls (OSG-9 Chpt 10)
- Note that alghough the topics in this section cover mostly interior spaces, physical security is applicable to both interior and exterior of a facility
- 3.9.1 Wiring closets/intermediate distribution facilities
    - **Wiring closets/intermediate distribution facilities (IDF)/main distribution frame (MDF)**: A wiring closet  or IDF is typically the smallest room that holds IT hardware
        - wiring closet is AKA premises wire distribution room, main distribution frame (MDF), intermediate distribution frame (IDF), and telecommunications room, and it is referred to as an IDF in (ISC)^2 CISSP objective 3.9.1
        - Main or intermediate distribution frames or wiring closets are the central storage areas for hardware, including routers, switches, cables, patch panels, and (sometimes) computer equipment. 
        - A wiring closet is the infrastructure component often located in the same position across multiple floors in order to provide a convenient means of linking floor-based networks together.
        - A wiring closet is where the networking cables are connected to other essential equipment, such as patch panels, switches, routers, local area network (LAN) extenders, and WAN backbone channels. 
        - usually includes telephony and network devices, alarm systems, circuit breaker panels, punch-down blocks, WAPs, video/security
        - may include a small number of servers 
        - unauthorized access to the wiring closest/IDF should be restricted to authorized personnel responsible for managing the IT hardware
            - Main or intermediate distribution frames should be secured using physical security such as locks, swipe card access on the doors, and video surveillance. Just one snipped cable can cause severe network outages.
            - use door access control (i.e. electronic badge system or electronic combination lock, or Use sensors on doors to log entries.)
            - Perform regular inspections of the closet.
            - Do not store flammable items in the closet.
            - from a layout perspective, wiring closets should be accessible only in private areas of the building interiors; people must pass through a visitor center and a controlled doorway prior to be able to enter a wiring closet
    - **Cable Plant Management Policy**: A cable plant management policy is used to define the physical structure and deployment of network cabling and related devices within a facility. A cable plant is the collection of interconnected cables and intermediary devices (such as cross-connects, patch panels, and switches) that establish the physical network. Elements of a cable plant include the following:
      - 🐊Entrance facility: Also known as the demarcation point or MDF, is the entrance point to the building where the cable from the provider connects the internal cable plant.
      - 🐊Equipment room: is the main wiring closet for the building, often connected to or adjacent to the MDF.
      - 🐊Backbone distribution system: provides wired connections between the equipment room and the telecommunications room, including cross-floor connections.
      - 🐊TeleComms Room: This serves the connection needs of a floor or a section of a large building by providing space for networking equipment and cabling systems. It also serves as the interconnection point between the backbone distribution system and the horizontal distribution system. The wiring closet is also known as premises wire distribution room, main distribution frame (MDF), intermediate distribution frame (IDF), and telecommunications room, and it is referred to as intermediate distribution facilities in (ISC)2 CISSP objective 3.9.1).
      - 🐊Horizontal distribution system:  provides the connection between the telecommunications room and work areas, often including cabling, cross-connection blocks, patch panels, and supporting hardware infrastructure (such as cable trays, cable hangers, and conduits).
- 3.9.2 Server rooms/data centers
    - **Server rooms/data centers**: server rooms, data centers, communication rooms, server vaults, and IT closets are enclosed, restricted, and protected rooms where mission critical servers and networks are housed
        - a server room is a bigger version of a wiring closet, much smaller than a data center
        - a server room typically houses network equipment, backup infrastructure and servers (more archaic versions include telephony equipment)
        - server rooms should be designed to support optimal operation of IT infrastructure and to block unauthorirzed human access or intervention
        - server rooms should be located at the core of the building (avoid ground floor, top floor, or in the basement)
        - Data centers should be located in the core of a building. Locating it on lower floors makes it susceptible to flooding and physical break-ins. Locating it on the top floor makes it vulnerable to wind and roof damage.
        - server rooms should have a single entrance (and an emergency exit)
        - server room should block unauthorized access, and entries and exits should be logged
        - datacenters are usually more protected than server rooms, and can include guards and mantraps
        - datacenters can be single-tenant or multitenant
- 3.9.3 Media storage facilities
    - **Media storage facilities**:often store backup tapes and other media, and should be protected just like a server room
        - depending on requirements a cabinet or safe could suffice
        - new blank media, and media that is reused (e.g. thumb drives, flash memory cards, portable hard drives) should be protected against theft and data remnant recovery
        - other recommendations:
            - employ a media librarian or custodian
            - use check-in/check-out process for media tracking
            - run a secure drive sanitization or zeroization when media is returned
        - note: a safe is a movable secured container that's not integrated into a building's construction; a vault is a permanent safe integrated into construction
- 3.9.4 Evidence storage
    - **Evidence storage**: as cybercrime events continue to increase, it is import to retain logs, audit trails, and other records of digital events; the evidence storage exists to preserve chain of custody
        - a key part of incident response is to gather evidence to perform root cause analysis
        - an evidence storage room should be protected like a server room or media storage facility
        - an evidence storage room can contain physical evidence (such as a smartphone) or digital evidence (such as a database)
- 3.9.5 Restricted and work area security
    - **Restricted and work area security**: covers the design and configuration of internal security, including work and visitor areas
        - includes areas that contain assets of higher value/importance which should have more restricted access
        - restricted work areas are used for sensitive operations, such as network/security ops 
        - protection should be similar to a server room, but video surveillance is typically limited to entry and exit points
- 3.9.6 Utilities and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
    - Power management in ascending order: surge protectors, power/power-line conditioner, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), generators
    - Types of UPS:
        - 🐍double conversion: functions by taking power from the wall outlet, storing it in a battery, pulling power out of the battery and feeding that power to the device/devices
        - 🐍line-interactive: has a surge protector, battery charger/inverter and voltage regulator positioned between the grid power source and the equipment (battery is not in line under normal conditions)
    - Commercial power problem types:
        - ⚒️**fault**: momentary loss of power
        - ⚒️**blackout**: complete loss of power
        - ⚒️**sag**: momentary low voltage
        - ⚒️**brownout**: prolonged low voltage
        - ⚒️**spike**: momentary high voltage
        - ⚒️**surge**: prolonged high voltage
        - ⚒️**inrush**: initial surge of power associated with connecting to a power source
    - Think through types of physical controls for HVAC:
        - restrict duct space continuity to controlled areas
        - use separate and redundant HVAC systems for computer equipment
    - Datacenter: 
        - should be on different power circuits from occupied areas
        - common to use a backup generator
        - 💢Generators are capable of providing backup power for a 📝sustained period of time in the event of a power loss, but they take time to activate.
        - 💢Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) provide immediate, battery-driven power for a 📝short period of time to cover momentary losses of power, which would not cover a sustained period of power loss.
- 3.9.7 Environmental issues
    - Environmental monitoring is the process of measuring and evaluating the quality of the environment within a given structure (e.g. temperature, humidity, dust, smoke), using things like chemical, biological, radiological, and microbiological detectors
    - Halon starves a fire of oxygen by disrupting the chemical reaction of combustion, but degrades into toxic gases at 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and is ⛔not environmentally friendly  (the 1987 Montreal protocol banned the creation of more of it).
    - If water-based sprinklers are used for fire suppression, damage to electronic equipment is likely; automate the shutoff of electricity prior to sprinkler trigger
    - Other environmental issues include earthquakes, power outages, tornados and wind
    - Secondary facilities should be located far enough away from the primary to ensure they won't be damaged by the same event
    - **Recommendations**:
        - 🔨Temperature: Rooms intended primarily to house computers should generally be kept between 59 and 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit (15 and 32 degrees Celsius). Some systems might require even lower temperatures.
        - 🔨Humidity: Humidity in a computer room should be maintained between 📝40-60%. According to the Heating, Refrigerations and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the humidity range considered most favorable for computer operations is 📝35–55%. Although there are varying standards, ASHRAE's range fits within ISC2's wider range of 📝20–80% and is more accurate and specific for optimal computer operations.Too much humidity can cause condensation leading to corrosion. Too little humidity causes static voltage\electricity to build up. 
        - 🔨Static Voltage:
             - 40 can cause Destruction of sensitive circuits and other electronic components
             - 1,000 ca cause Scrambling of monitor displays
             - 1,500 can cause Destruction of data stored on hard drives
             - 2,000 can cause Abrupt system shutdown
             - 4,000 can cause Printer jam or component damage
             - 17,000 can cause Permanent circuit damage
          
- 3.9.8 Fire prevention, detection, and suppression
    - Protecting personnel from harm should always be the most important goal of any security or protection system!
    - In addition to protecting people, fire detection and suppression is designed to keep asset damage caused by fire, smoke, heat, and suppression materials to a minimum
    - **Fire triangle**: three triangle corners represent fuel, heat, and oxygen; the center of the triangle represents the chemical reaction among these three elements
        - if you can remove any one of the four items from the fire triangle, the fire can be extinguished
    - Fire suppression mediums:
        - water suppresses temperature
        - soda acid and other dry powders suppress the fuel supply
        - - **VESDA**: very early smoke detection process (air sensing device brand name)
        - carbon dioxide (CO2) suppresses the oxygen supply thus can be harmful to humans 
        - In 1994, the Montreal Protocol banned the creation of more halon. Halon is an environmental hazard because it destroys the ozone layer which protects the earth.
        - Halon substitutes and other nonflammable gases interfere with the chemistry of combustion and/or suppress the oxygen supply. for example FM-200, which is a chemical suppressant commonly used in place of water in data centers.
            - 📝FM-200 is a gas that extinguishes fires, making it a safe suppression system for electronics. FM-200 is a colorless suppression agent that is electrically non-conductive and safe for humans. It extinguishes fire through heat absorption. It can be used to replace Halon in fire suppression systems.
            - FM-200 uses HFC-227ea, leaves no residue, and does not require costly cleanup. FM-200 systems replaced halon. 
    - Fire stages:
        - 🍐**Stage 1**: **incipient stage**: early warning of fire. At this stage, there is only air ionization and no smoke
        - 🍐**Stage 2**: **smoke stage**: smoke is visible from the point of ignition
        - 🍐**Stage 3**: **flame stage**: this is when a flame can be seen with the naked eye
        - 🍐**Stage 4**: **heat stage**: at stage 4, there is an intense heat buildup and everything in the area burns
    - Fire extinguisher classes:
        - **🧯Class A**: common combustibles e.g wood or paper 🟡Ash (water, foam, wet chemical agent)
        - **🧯Class B**: liquids      🟡boil (CO2, Halon or an acceptable halon substitute like FM-200, , Sodium bicarbonate, mono-ammonium phosphate, foam, or dry powder. and soda acid)
        - **🧯Class C**: electrical   🟡conduct (FM-200, CO2, dry chemical agents, Sodium bicarbonate and mono-ammonium phosphate) require carbon dioxide or dry powder to extinguish them.
        - **🧯Class D**: metal        🟡dilythium (Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Dry Powder Extinguishers)
        - **🧯Class K**: cooking material (oil/grease) 🟡kitchen (Potassium Acetate Solution, Ansul R-102)
    - Four main types of suppression:
        - **👨‍🚒wet pipe system**: (AKA closed head system): is always ✏️filled with water; water discharges immediately when suppression is triggered
        - **👨‍🚒dry pipe system**: contains compressed inert ✏️gas
        - **👨‍🚒preaction system**: a variation of the dry pipe system that uses a ✏️two-stage detection and release mechanism. It is the best type of water-­based fire suppression system for a computer facility because it provides the opportunity to prevent the release of water in the event of a false alarm or false initial trigger. The most common cause of false positive for water-based fire suppression systems is humans. A preaction fire suppression system activates in two steps. The pipes fill with water once the early signs of a fire are detected. The system does not dispense water until heat sensors on the sprinkler heads trigger the second phase.
        - **👨‍🚒deluge system**: uses larger pipes and delivers ✏️larger volume of water
    - Note: Most sprinkler heads feature a glass bulb filled with a glycerin-based liquid; this liquid expands when it comes in contact with air heated to between 135 and 165 degrees; when the liquid expands, it shatters its glass confines and the sprinkler head activates
- 3.9.9 Power (e.g., redundant, backup)
    - Consider designing power to provide for high availability
    - Most power systems have to be tested at regular intervals
    - As part of the design, mandate redundant power systems to accommodate testing, upgrades and other maintenance 
    - Additionally, test failover to a redundant power system and ensure it is fully functional
    - The International Electrical Testing Association (NETA) has developed standards around testing power systems
    - Battery backup/fail-over power (including UPS/generators):
        - this is a system that collects power into a battery but can switch over to pulling power from the battery when the power grid fails
        - generally, this type of system was implemented to supply power to an entire building rather than just one or a few devices

- 🔴**Administrative Physical Controls**: The six common physical security control mechanisms is ✏️Deter (guard dogs, Lighting), ✏️Deny (mantrap, turnstile, gate), ✏️Detect (CCTV,motion sensor), ✏️Delay (locks), ✏️Determine, ✏️Decide. 
    - The first line of defense against an initial attempt to access a physical asset should be a deterrent control such as signs, lighting, or policy. A physical security program should attempt to thwart threats in the following order:
        - 🆎Deterrence/Deterrent controls
        - 🆎Denial/Preventative
        - 🆎Detection/Detective controls
        - 🆎Delay/Preventative and Compensating controls
    - facility construction and selection
    - site management
    - building design
    - **Locks:**
         - 🔒A tumbler lock is a common type of lock mechanism found in many doors and padlocks. It consists of a series of spring-loaded pins (tumblers) that align when the correct key is inserted, allowing the lock to turn and open. Incorrect keys won't align the tumblers, preventing the lock from turning. Tumbler locks offer basic security but are vulnerable to lock-picking techniques.
         - 🔒A mortise lock is a type of door lock that is set within a rectangular cavity, or mortise, in the door. It typically consists of a lock body with a latch, a strike plate, and a cylinder or keyhole. Mortise locks are known for their durability and security, making them common in commercial and residential applications. They are often considered more secure than standard cylindrical locks due to their robust construction and the fact that they are more challenging to pick or force open.
         - 🔒A biometric lock is a security device that uses unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, retinal patterns, or voice recognition, to authenticate and grant access. It's a modern, highly secure alternative to traditional key or card-based locking systems, enhancing both convenience and protection.
         - 🔒A cipher lock is a type of mechanical or electronic lock that requires users to enter a combination or code to unlock it, rather than using a traditional key. A cipher lock is characterized by a keypad, requiring a specific numerical sequence on the keypad to unlock an entrance. Keypads are used in data centers or even within restricted areas to add an extra level of security. Cipher locks are commonly used to control access to secure areas, such as offices, server rooms, or other restricted locations.
             - 🥑Mechanical Cipher Locks: These locks are purely mechanical, with no electronics involved. They use physical buttons that, when pressed in the correct sequence, allow the door to be opened.
             - 🥑Electronic Cipher Locks: These locks use an electronic keypad and may include additional features such as keycards, biometrics, or logging of access attempts 
    - **personnel controls** e.g Badges, identification cards, and security IDs, turnstile, mantraps, access control vestibules (An access control vestibule is a double set of doors that is often protected by a guard and used to contain a subject until their identity and authentication is verified.)
        - Mantraps use two sets of doors to control access to a facility. This may be used to prevent piggybacking by monitoring use of the mantrap to allow only a single individual to enter a facility at a time. They may also be used to allow manual inspection of individuals or perform other security screening. Mantraps are also commonly known as access control vestibules.
    - awareness training
    - emergency response and procedures.
        - **Security Guards**: are usually unaware of the scope of the operations within a facility and are therefore not thoroughly equipped to know how to respond to every situation. Though this is considered a disadvantage, the lack of knowledge of the scope of the operations within a facility can also be considered an advantage because this supports confidentiality of those operations and thus helps reduce the possibility that a security guard will be involved in the disclosure of confidential information. The main disadvantages of security guards include:
            - Not all environments and facilities support security guards. This may be because of actual human incompatibility or the layout, design, location, and construction of the facility.
            - Not all security guards are themselves reliable.
            - Prescreening, bonding, and training do not guarantee that you won’t end up with an ineffective or unreliable security guard.
- Physical Access Control:
     - Locks and Keys, Security Guards, Guard dogs, CCTV, Security Alarms
- 🔴**Technical Physical Controls**
     - **Motion Detectors**: A motion detector, or motion sensor, is a device that senses movement or sound in a specific area, and it is a common element of intruder detection systems. Many types of motion detectors exist, including the following:
         - 🍳digital motion detector monitors for  changes in the digital pattern of a monitored area (smart security camera).
         - 🍳passive infrared (PIR) or heat-based motion detector monitors for changes in the heat levels and patterns.
         - 🍳wave pattern motion detector transmits a consistent low ultrasonic or high microwave frequency signal into a monitored area and monitors for changes or disturbances in the reflected pattern.
         - 🍳capacitance motion detector senses changes in the electrical or magnetic field surrounding a monitored object.
         - 🍳photoelectric motion detector senses changes in visible light levels. Usually  deployed in dark rooms.
         - 🍳passive audio motion detector listens for abnormal sounds in the monitored area.

     - **Intrusion Alarms**: Whenever a motion detector registers a significant or meaningful change in the environment, it triggers an alarm. An alarm is a separate mechanism that triggers a deterrent, a repellent, and/or a notification.:
         - 🍊Deterrent alarms: trigger deterrents may engage additional locks, shut doors, and so on. The goal of such an alarm is to make further intrusion or attack more difficult.
         - 🍊Repellent alarms: Alarms that trigger repellents usually sound an audio siren or bell and turn on lights.
         - 🍊Notification alarms: trigger notification often silent from the intruder/attacker perspective to notify administrators, security guards, and law enforcement.
         - Alarms are also categorized by where they are located: local, centralized or proprietary, or auxiliary.
             - 🔔Local alarm system: Local alarm systems must broadcast an audible (up to 120 decibels [dB]) alarm signal that can be easily heard up to 400 feet away. must be protected from tampering and disablement. to be effective, a security team or guards must be positioned nearby who can respond when the alarm is triggered.
             - 🔔Central station system: The alarm is usually silent locally, but offsite monitoring agents are notified so that they can respond to the security breach. Most residential security systems are of this type such as Brinks and ADT. In a proprietary system, the organization has its own onsite security staff waiting to respond to security breaches.
             - 🔔Auxiliary alarm system: Auxiliary alarm systems can be added to either local or centralized alarm systems. When the security perimeter is breached, emergency services are notified to respond to the incident and arrive at the location. This can include fire, police, and medical services.
     - 🦁**Heartbeat Sensors:** is a  technology that issues an alert if the communications lines for the alarm system are unexpectedly cut. Heartbeat sensors send periodic status messages from the alarm system to the monitoring center. The monitoring center triggers an alarm if it does not receive a status message for a prolonged period of time, indicating that communications were disrupted.  A heartbeat sensor is a mechanism by which the communication pathway is either constantly or periodically checked with a test signal. If the receiving station detects a failed heartbeat signal, such as the loss of the constant signal or missing one or two interval checks, the alarm triggers automatically. This measure is designed to prevent intruders from circumventing the detection and alarm system by cutting power, cutting communication cables, or jamming radio signals. 
     - **Cameras**: Can be overt and obvious in order to provide a deterrent benefit, or hidden and concealed in order to primarily provide a detective benefit. Vary in type, including visible light, infrared, and motion-triggered recording. Some cameras are fixed, whereas others support remote control of automated pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ).
         - should be positioned to watch exit and entry points allowing any change in authorization or access level.
         - should also be used to monitor activities around valuable assets and to provide additional protection in public areas such as parking structures and walkways
         -  should be positioned to have clear sight lines of all exterior walls, entrance and exit points, and interior hallways.
         -  Simple motion recognition or motion-triggered cameras may be fooled by animals, birds, insects, weather, or foliage. In order to distinguish between a false alarm and an intrusion, a secondary verification mechanism should be used.
         - **Closed-circuit television (CCTV)** systems act as a secondary verification mechanism for physical presence because they allow security officials to view the interior of the facility when a motion alarm sounds to determine the current occupants and their activities.
         -  **Enhanced video surveillance (EVS)**: systems are capable of object detection, which can include faces, devices, and weapons. Some can even automatically identify individuals and track their motion (gait analysis).  EVSs can be enhanced using machine learning to improve video monitoring through automation, improved image recognition, and pattern/activity interpretation
     - **Lighting**: Lighting is often claimed to be the most commonly deployed physical security mechanism. However, lighting is only a deterrent and not a strong deterrent. It should not be used as the primary or sole protection mechanism except in areas with a low threat level. Your entire site, inside and out, should be well lit. This provides for easy identification of personnel and makes it easier to notice intrusions.
     - Key locks are also most common and inexpensive form of physical access control device for both interior and exterior use. 
     - **Fire Detectors**: There are many types of fire detection systems:
         - Fixed-temperature detection systems: trigger suppression when a specific temperature is reached. inexpensive and is the most common with potentially visible sprinkler head which serves as both the detection and release mechanism (plastic that melts at a specific temperature or small glass vial containing chemicals that vaporize to over-pressurize and shatter the container at a specific temperature to trigger release). This system is inexpensive and very reliable
         - 🚒Rate-of-rise detection systems: trigger suppression when the speed at which the temperature changes reaches a specific level. These are often digital temperature measuring devices, which can be fooled by HVAC heating during winter months and thus are not widely deployed.
         - 🚒Flame-actuated systems trigger suppression based on the infrared energy of flames. This is fast and reliable but often fairly expensive and is often only used in high-risk environments.
         - 🚒Smoke-actuated systems use photoelectric or radioactive ionization sensors as triggers. Either method monitors for light or radiation obstruction or reduction across an air gap caused by particles in the air. It is intended to be triggered by smoke, but dust and steam can sometimes trigger the alarm.
         - 🚒The radioactive ionization-based smoke detectors use americium as a source of alpha particles and a Geiger counter to detect the rate of these particles' transmission across the air gap. This element produces such low levels of radiation that a layer of dead skin cells is sufficient to block its transmission.
         - 🚒Incipient smoke detection systems, also known as aspirating sensors, are able to detect the chemicals typically associated with the very early stages of combustion before a fire is other wise detectible via other means. These devices are even more costly than flame-actuated sensors and are also only used in high-risk or critical environments.

- 🔴**SYMMETRIC**
    - 💊AES- Block Cipher, 📝Bock Size 128, 📝Key Size 128, 192, 256 🥇 (AES provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication when implemented properly.
        - Nonrepudiation which requires the use of a public key cryptosystem to prevent users from falsely denying that they originated a message and cannot be achieved with a symmetric cryptosystem, such as AES.)
        - It is both substitution and transposition
        - NIST selected the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2000 to replace the older Data Encryption Standard (DES) that had known vulnerabilities. The AES cipher allows the use of three key lengths:
            - 128-bit keys require 10 rounds of encryption
            - 192-bit keys require 12 rounds of encryption
            - 256-bit keys require 14 rounds of encryption 
    - 💊Blowfish - 📝Bock Size 64, 📝Key Size 32 - 448 (uses 16 round of encryption regardless of key lenght. Blowfish was invented by Bruce Schneier who chose not to patent it but made it available for free, public use. Bruce Schneider also created twofish and threefish. It is both substitution and transposition.)
    - 💊DES - Block Cipher, 📝Bock Size 64, 📝Key Size 56. It is both substitution and transposition. Data Encryption Standard (DES) was published in 1977 as a standard cryptosystem for government communications. DES has a key size of 64 bits; however, 8 bits are used for parity, giving DES an effective key length of 56 bits. DES has a block size of 64 bits, and each block is put through 16 rounds of encryption functions.

    - 💊Serpent - 📝block size of 128 bits,  📝key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits (was created and designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen)
    - 💊SAFER++ "Secure And Fast Encryption Routine++." - same key is used for both encryption and decryption. 📝Block sizes 64 bits or 128 bits, 📝key sizes ranging from 64 bits to 256 bits.
    - In symmetric key cryptography, both block size and key size are critical parameters that define the characteristics and security of an encryption algorithm. 
         - 💠Block Size: Determines the size of data chunks processed in one encryption or decryption operation. If the plaintext is not a multiple of the block size, padding may be required to ensure that the entire block is filled. A larger block size allows the algorithm to handle larger amounts of data per encryption operation, which can improve efficiency and security.
         - 💠Key Size: Determines the strength of the encryption by defining the length of the key used in the encryption algorithm. Larger key sizes can result in increased computational overhead during encryption and decryption, potentially impacting performance, but offers increased security by making it harder to perform brute-force attacks.

- 🔴**ASSYMETRIC (use a pair of keys for each user)**
    - 💊RSA - Key Transport Algorithm, ✏️Size 512
    - 💊Diffie-Hellman - Key Exchange Algorithm
    - 💊EL Gamal - Key Exchange Algorithm (doubles the length of any message it encrypts)
    - 💊ECC - Elliptic Curve Algorithm, Size Variable (smaller key size due to 160 EC Key = 1024 RSA)
    - 💊TLS - In TLS, both the server and the client communicate using an ephemeral symmetric session key. They exchange this key using asymmetric cryptography, but all encrypted content is ­protected using symmetric cryptography.

- 🔴**Key Excahnge Algorithms**:
    - ✈️Diffie-Hellman (DH): Based on the mathematical difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. Susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks if not properly authenticated. Variants include Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) for forward secrecy. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm allows for the secure exchange of symmetric encryption keys over a public network
    - ✈️RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): Public key algorithm that can be used for both encryption and digital signatures, including key exchange. Based on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. Can be used to securely exchange symmetric keys by encrypting them with the recipient’s public key.
        - Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm. RSA can be used for transmitting a symmetric key across a network or creating a digital signature. It is very commonly used on web pages to both send the website a symmetric key that is selected by the browser as well as validate the identity of the website. 
    - ✈️Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH): An adaptation of Diffie-Hellman using elliptic curve cryptography to provide equivalent security with smaller key sizes. More efficient and faster compared to traditional Diffie-Hellman. Commonly used in modern secure communications (e.g., TLS).
    - ✈️Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES): Combines elliptic curve cryptography for key exchange with symmetric encryption and message authentication. Provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Utilizes ECDH for key exchange and AES for encryption.
    - ✈️Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV): An authenticated protocol for key exchange using elliptic curves, enhancing security by incorporating digital signatures. Provides resistance to certain attacks. Used in various standards, including IEEE P1363 and NIST.
    - ✈️Station-to-Station (STS) Protocol: Combines Diffie-Hellman key exchange with digital signatures to authenticate the communicating parties. Mitigates man-in-the-middle attacks by authenticating the exchanged keys. Utilizes both public key cryptography and Diffie-Hellman.
    - ✈️Internet Key Exchange (IKE): A protocol used to set up a secure and authenticated communication channel, often used with IPsec. Supports mutual authentication and dynamic key exchange. It is used in IPsec to negotiate tunnel parameters.
    - ✈️Secure Remote Password (SRP): A password-based key exchange protocol that ensures mutual authentication without transmitting the actual password. Provides resistance against dictionary attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. Useful in secure login scenarios where passwords are used.

**In a zero-knowledge proof**, one individual demonstrates to another that they can achieve a result that requires sensitive information without actually disclosing the sensitive information

- 🟢**TEMPEST-derived technology** allows the electronic emanations that devices produce (known as Van Eck radiation) to be read from a distance (this process is known as Van Eck phreaking). TEMPEST eavesdropping or Van Eck phreaking countermeasures include the following:
    - 🐌Faraday Cage: A Faraday cage is an enclosure that blocks or absorbs electromagnetic fields or signals. Faraday cage containers, computer cases, rack-­mount systems, rooms, or even building materials are used to create a blockage against the transmission of data, information, metadata, or other emanations from computers and other electronics. Devices inside a Faraday cage can use EM fields for communications, such as wireless or Bluetooth, but devices outside of the cage will not be able to eavesdrop on the signals of the systems within the cage.
    - 🐌White Noise:  White noise generates false emanations that effectively "jam" the true emanations from electronic equipment. It is a physical security control that broadcasts false emanations constantly to mask the presence of true electromagnetic emanations from computing equipment.
    - 🐌Control Zone
- The TEMPEST program creates technology that is not susceptible to Van Eck phreaking attacks because it reduces or suppresses natural electromagnetic emanations.

- 🟢**Mobile Device Management (MDM) Concepts**:  Security. 🍎NIST SP 800-124 is a guideline for managing the security of mobile devices in the enterprise.
  - ❄️Mobile Device Management (MDM) are systems used to manage and secure endpoints within an organization. MDM primarily focused on managing mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and supported Devices generally includes mobile operating systems like iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile.
  - ❄️Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) are also systems used to manage and secure endpoints within an organization. Unified endpoint management (UEM) is type of software tool that provides a single management platform to control mobile, PC, IoT, wearables, ICSs, and other devices. UEM is intended to replace MDM and enterprise mobility management (EMM) products by combining the features of numerous products into one solution. UEM and MDM are a software solution to the challenging task of managing the myriad mobile devices that employees use to access company resources. The goals of UEM and MDM are to improve security, provide monitoring, enable remote management, and support troubleshooting. Application allow listing may be an element of mobile device management but is only part of a full UEM/MDM solution.
   - 🍊Corporate-­owned: A corporate-­owned mobile strategy is when the company purchases mobile devices that can support compliance with the security policy. These devices are to be used exclusively for company purposes, and users should not perform any personal tasks on them.
     - This option often requires workers to carry a second device for personal use.
     - Corporate-­owned clearly assigns responsibility for device oversight to the organization.
     - The following allow for comingling of data and have unclear or vague security responsibility assignments as a concept or policy basis.
   - 🍊Bring Your Own Device BYOD: is a policy that allows employees to bring their own personal mobile devices to work and use those devices to connect to business resources and/or the internet through the company net work.
   - 🍊Corporate-­owned, personally enabled (COPE): The concept of COPE means the organization purchases devices and provides them to employees. Each user is then able to customize the device and use it for both work activities and personal activities.
   - 🍊Choose your own device (CYOD): The concept of CYOD provides users with a list of approved devices from which to select the device to implement.
   -  **Mobile Security Concepts**
       - ⚒️Geofencing is a security feature commonly utilized in conjunction with mobile devices to restrict access based on location. Location is typically determined by using the device's GPS system (which itself is referred to as geolocation services).
       - ⚒️Geotagging refers to the ability of a mobile device to incorporate time, date, and location data into the metadata of media that is created by the device.
       - ⚒️Rooting refers to the act of bypassing the native security restrictions of a mobile device to grant its user full device privileges. Rooted devices can typically be customized in ways that unrooted devices cannot, but frequently have greater exposure to security risks.
       - ⚒️Sideloading refers to a method of mobile app installation that uses a locally executed installer to bypass the managed installation (and security screening) typically provided by an app store.
- 🟦**Binary Calculations**: Consider the following:
    - X: 0 1 1 0 1 0
    - Y: 0 0 1 1 0 1
         - 🕯️⊕ symbol represents the ♏XOR function and returns a true value when only one of the input values is true. If both values are false or both values are true, the output of the XOR function is false: 0 1 0 1 1 1
         - 🕯️ ∧ symbol is the result if these two values were combined using the 🔼AND (the ∧ symbol) function, which returns a value of true if the two values are both true: 0 0 1 0 0 0
         - 🕯️ ∨ symbol is the result if these two values were combined using the 🔽OR (the ∨ symbol) function, which returns a value of true if either input values is true: 0 1 1 1 1 1
         - 🕯️ ~ symbol is the result if only the X value was subjected to the ⛔NOR (the ~ symbol) function, which reverses the value of an input: 1 0 0 1 0 1
